0,"  Technology-sustained pervasive games, contrary to technology-supported
pervasive games, can be understood as computer games interfacing with the
physical world. Pervasive games are known to make use of 'non-standard input
devices' and with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), pervasive
applications can be expected to move beyond games. This dissertation is
requirements- and development-focused Design Science research for distributed
technology-sustained pervasive applications, incorporating knowledge from the
domains of Distributed Computing, Mixed Reality, Context-Aware Computing,
Geographical Information Systems and IoT. Computer video games have existed for
decades, with a reusable game engine to drive them. If pervasive games can be
understood as computer games interfacing with the physical world, can computer
game engines be used to stage pervasive games? Considering the use of
non-standard input devices in pervasive games and the rise of IoT, how will
this affect the architectures supporting the broader set of pervasive
applications? The use of a game engine can be found in some existing pervasive
game projects, but general research into how the domain of pervasive games
overlaps with that of video games is lacking. When an engine is used, a
discussion of, what type of engine is most suitable and what properties are
being fulfilled by the engine, is often not part of the discourse. This
dissertation uses multiple iterations of the method framework for Design
Science for the design and development of three software system architectures.
In the face of IoT, the problem of extending pervasive games into a fourth
software architecture, accommodating a broader set of pervasive applications,
is explicated. The requirements, for technology-sustained pervasive games, are
verified through the design, development and demonstration of the three
software system architectures. The ...

1,"  Based on the empirical analysis of the dependency network in 18 Java
projects, we develop a novel model of network growth which considers both: an
attachment mechanism and the addition of new nodes with a heterogeneous
distribution of their initial degree, $k_0$. Empirically we find that the
cumulative degree distributions of initial degrees and of the final network,
follow power-law behaviors: $P(k_{0}) \propto k_{0}^{1-\alpha}$, and
$P(k)\propto k^{1-\gamma}$, respectively. For the total number of links as a
function of the network size, we find empirically $K(N)\propto N^{\beta}$,
where $\beta$ is (at the beginning of the network evolution) between 1.25 and
2, while converging to $\sim 1$ for large $N$. This indicates a transition from
a growth regime with increasing network density towards a sustainable regime,
which revents a collapse because of ever increasing dependencies. Our
theoretical framework is able to predict relations between the exponents
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, which also link issues of software engineering and
developer activity. These relations are verified by means of computer
simulations and empirical investigations. They indicate that the growth of real
Open Source Software networks occurs on the edge between two regimes, which are
either dominated by the initial degree distribution of added nodes, or by the
preferential attachment mechanism. Hence, the heterogeneous degree distribution
of newly added nodes, found empirically, is essential to describe the laws of
sustainable growth in networks.

4,"  Currently, organizations are transforming their business processes into
e-services and service-oriented architectures to improve coordination across
sales, marketing, and partner channels, to build flexible and scalable systems,
and to reduce integration-related maintenance and development costs. However,
this new paradigm is still fragile and lacks many features crucial for building
sustainable and progressive computing infrastructures able to rapidly respond
and adapt to the always-changing market and environmental business. This paper
proposes a novel framework for building sustainable Ecosystem- Oriented
Architectures (EOA) using e-service models. The backbone of this framework is
an ecosystem layer comprising several computing units whose aim is to deliver
universal interoperability, transparent communication, automated management,
self-integration, self-adaptation, and security to all the interconnected
services, components, and devices in the ecosystem. Overall, the proposed model
seeks to deliver a comprehensive and a generic sustainable business IT model
for developing agile e-enterprises that are constantly up to new business
constraints, trends, and requirements. Future research can improve upon the
proposed model so much so that it supports computational intelligence to help
in decision making and problem solving.

5,"  Scientific software applications are increasingly developed by large
interdiscplinary teams operating on functional modules organized around a
common software framework, which is capable of integrating new functional
capabilities without modifying the core of the framework. In such environment,
software correctness and modularity take precedence at the expense of code
performance, which is an important concern during execution on supercomputing
facilities, where the allocation of core-hours is a valuable resource. To
alleviate the performance problems, we propose automated performance tuning
(autotuning) of software to extract the maximum performance on a given hardware
platform and to enable performance portability across heterogeneous hardware
platforms. The resulting code remains generic without committing to a
particular software stack and yet is compile-time specializable for maximal
sustained performance.

40,"  Like other engineering disciplines, software engineering should also have
principles to guide the construction of sustainable computer applications.
Tangible properties include a) unlimited scalability, b) maximal
reproducibility, and c) optimizable energy efficiency. In practice, we expect a
sustainable scientific application should be written once and execute many
times on multiple different processing platforms of different scales with
optimized performance and energy efficiency. For more than two decades,
explicit parallel programming/processing paradigms only focused on performance.
Practices showed that the rigid program-data binding prohibited dynamic runtime
resource optimization and fault isolation, making it difficult to reproduce
applications in scale. This paper reports our practice and experiences in
search of the first principles of sustainable software engineering for compute
and data intensive applications. Specifically, we report our practice and
experiences using implicit parallel programming/processing paradigms.

contribute to variation in quantitative traits) in experimental crosses. Its
development began in 2000. There have been 38 software releases since 2001. The
latest release contains 35k lines of R code and 24k lines of C code, plus 15k
lines of code for the documentation. Challenges in the development and
maintenance of the software are discussed. A key to the success of R/qtl is
that it remains a central tool for the chief developer's own research work, and
so its maintenance is of selfish importance.

software architects for many years, yet the advent of using diversity to
achieve sustainability is overlooked. We argue that option thinking is an
effective decision making tool to evaluate the trade-offs between architectural
strategies and their long-term values under uncertainty. Our method extends
cost-benefit analysis method CBAM. Unlike CBAM, our focus is on valuing the
options which diversification can embed in the architecture and their
corresponding value using real options pricing theory. The intuitive assumption
is that the value of these options can provide the architect with insights on
the long-term performance of these decisions in relation to some scenarios of
interest and use them as the basis for reasoning about sustainability. The
method aims to answer the following: (1) Is diversification of architectural
decisions beneficial and when they can help in sustaining the software, (2)
When, where and to what extent. The proposed model is illustrated and evaluated
using a case study from the literature referred to as GridStix.

that obviates both issues. By pipelining the computation, and thanks to a
sophisticated transfer strategy, we stream data from hard disk to main memory
to GPUs and achieve sustained peak performance; with respect to a
highly-optimized CPU implementation, our algorithm shows a speedup of 2.6x.
Moreover, the approach lends itself to multiple GPUs and attains almost perfect

extract, analyse, and combine the results from multiple studies in order to
develop an RE framework for sustainable eLearning systems.
  We call a system sustainable, if it has a positive effect on and whose direct
and indirect negative impacts resulting from its development, deployment, and
usage are minimal. Sustainability has various dimensions. We classify
sustainability requirements of eLearning system to five dimensions: individual
(human), social, technical, environmental, and economic. In this paper, we
focus on human and social aspects (i.e., individual needs the relationship of
people within society), as the eLearning systems have a very strong impact on
human dimension of sustainability, where their impact on environmental
dimension is rather small. This also provides us a basis to identify the
corresponding requirements for sustainable eLearning systems. These
requirements include collaboration, learner-centred features, leadership
development and the reuse of the learning materials. As a result, achieving
individual and social requirements for eLearning systems would provide higher
quality of leaning and teaching, as well as better opportunities for learning

report includes a description of the alternative, experimental submission and
review process, two workshop keynote presentations, a series of lightning
talks, a discussion on sustainability, and five discussions from the topic
areas of exploring sustainability; software development experiences; credit &
incentives; reproducibility & reuse & sharing; and code testing & code review.
For each topic, the report includes a list of tangible actions that were
proposed and that would lead to potential change. The workshop recognized that
reliance on scientific software is pervasive in all areas of world-leading
research today. The workshop participants then proceeded to explore different
perspectives on the concept of sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of
sustainable scientific software were identified from their experiences. In
addition, recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files
and software prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in
sustainable software engineering. There was also broad consensus that formal
training in software development or engineering was rare among the
practitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of
community via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their
size and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education

  The last years he interested in the computational models of geometrical and

and information technologies. In the recent years the interest in computation
models based on object notion has grown tremendously stimulating an interest to
Kuzin's ideas. This year of 50th Anniversary of Cybernetics and on the occasion

enabling research data sharing without barriers. It was founded in March 2013
by the Australian Government, the European Commission, and the USA NSF and
NIST. It is a bottom-up organisation which after 2 years and a half of
existence gathers around 3,000 members from 100 different countries. Work in
RDA is organised in a bottom-up way, through Working Groups and Interest Groups
proposed by the community. These Groups can deal with any aspect of research
data sharing, which means a huge diversity in the activities. Some scientific
communities use the RDA as a neutral place to hold the discussions about their
disciplinary interoperability framework. Astronomy has the IVOA and the FITS
Committee for that purpose, and the ADASS Colloquia to deal with astronomical
data systems. But many RDA topics are of interest for us, for instance data
citation, including citation of dynamic data bases and data repositories, or
certification of data repositories. Also lessons learnt in building the IVOA
and data sharing in astronomy are injected in the discussion of RDA
organisation and procedures. The RDA is a unique platform to meet data
practitioners from many countries, disciplines and profiles, to grasp ideas to
improve our data practices, to identify topics of common interest and to raise
interesting subjects for discussion involving specialists from many disciplines
and countries by proposing new Interest and Working Groups.

addressed by software engineering. Spreadsheets are a powerful modeling
language, allowing strategic rapid model change, and enabling exploratory
modeling. Spreadsheets users learn slowly with experience because they focus on
the problem domain not programming. The heterogeneity of spreadsheet users

consumer can detect, choose and utilize the resources (infrastructure, software
and platform) and provide service to user based on pay per use model as
computing utilities. Current computing mechanism is effective, particular for
medium and small cloud based companies, in which it permits easy and reliable
access to cloud services like infrastructure, software and platform. Present
cloud computing is almost similar to the existing models: cluster computing and
grid computing. The important key technical features of cloud computing which
includes autonomic service, rapid elasticity, end-to-end virtualization
support, on-demand resource pooling and transparency in cloud billing. Further,
non-technical features of cloud computing includes environment friendliness,
little maintenance overhead, lower upfront costs, faster time to deployments,
Service Level Agreement (SLA) and pay-as-you-go-model. In distributed computing
environment, unpredictability of service is a fact, so same possible in cloud
also. The success of next-generation Cloud Computing infrastructures will
depend on how capably these infrastructures will discover and dynamically
tolerate computing platforms, which meet randomly varying resource and service
requirements of Cloud costumer applications.

148,"  DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and
operations (Ops) teams. The need for such an integration is driven by the
requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in
the business environment. As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily
introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new
releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional
perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools,
activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality
attributes of a software system, namely performance.
  Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of
resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource
utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper
and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In
order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are
required during development and operation of these systems as well as during
the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically
summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas
activities during operations are called Application Performance Management
(APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but
the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration
between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to
support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area.

between highly efficient yet typically cumbersome low-level languages such as
C, C++, and Fortran and highly expressive yet typically slow high-level
languages such as Python and MATLAB. This paper explores how Julia, a modern
programming language for numerical computing which claims to bridge this divide
by incorporating recent advances in language and compiler design (such as
just-in-time compilation), can be used for implementing software and algorithms
fundamental to the field of operations research, with a focus on mathematical
optimization. In particular, we demonstrate algebraic modeling for linear and
nonlinear optimization and a partial implementation of a practical simplex
code. Extensive cross-language benchmarks suggest that Julia is capable of

176,"  The paper describes clustering problems from the combinatorial viewpoint. A
brief systemic survey is presented including the following: (i) basic
clustering problems (e.g., classification, clustering, sorting, clustering with
an order over cluster), (ii) basic approaches to assessment of objects and
object proximities (i.e., scales, comparison, aggregation issues), (iii) basic
approaches to evaluation of local quality characteristics for clusters and
total quality characteristics for clustering solutions, (iv) clustering as
multicriteria optimization problem, (v) generalized modular clustering
framework, (vi) basic clustering models/methods (e.g., hierarchical clustering,
k-means clustering, minimum spanning tree based clustering, clustering as
assignment, detection of clisue/quasi-clique based clustering, correlation
clustering, network communities based clustering), Special attention is
targeted to formulation of clustering as multicriteria optimization models.
Combinatorial optimization models are used as auxiliary problems (e.g.,
assignment, partitioning, knapsack problem, multiple choice problem,
morphological clique problem, searching for consensus/median for structures).
Numerical examples illustrate problem formulations, solving methods, and
applications. The material can be used as follows: (a) a research survey, (b) a
fundamental for designing the structure/architecture of composite modular
clustering software, (c) a bibliography reference collection, and (d) a
tutorial.

increased flexibility and cost efficiency for future carrier networks. NSC has
received considerable attention in the standardization and research communities
lately. However, NSC is largely undefined in the peer-reviewed literature. In
fact, a literature review reveals that the role of NSC enabling technologies is
up for discussion, and so are the key research challenges lying ahead. This
paper addresses these topics by motivating our research interest towards
advanced dynamic NSC and detailing the main aspects to be considered in the
context of carrier-grade telecommunication networks. We present design
considerations and system requirements alongside use cases that illustrate the
advantages of adopting NSC. We detail prominent research challenges during the
typical lifecycle of a network service chain in an operational
telecommunications network, including service chain description, programming,
deployment, and debugging, and summarize our security considerations. We

235,"  This paper proposes a software repository model together with associated
tooling and consists of several complex, open-source GUI driven applications
ready to be used in empirical software research. We start by providing the
rationale for our repository and criteria that guided us in searching for
suitable applications. We detail the model of the repository together with
associated artifacts and supportive tooling. We detail current applications in
the repository together with ways in which it can be further extended. Finally
we provide examples of how our repository facilitates research in software
visualization and testing.

236,"  The term Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is typically used to describe
software development approaches in which abstract models of software systems
are created and systematically transformed to concrete implementations. In this
paper we give an overview of current research in MDE and discuss some of the
major challenges that must be tackled in order to realize the MDE vision of
software development. We argue that full realizations of the MDE vision may not
be possible in the near to medium-term primarily because of the wicked problems
involved. On the other hand, attempting to realize the vision will provide
insights that can be used to significantly reduce the gap between evolving
software complexity and the technologies used to manage complexity.

243,"  Background: The need for empirical investigations in software engineering is
growing. Many researchers nowadays, conduct and validate their solutions using
empirical research. Survey is one empirical method which enables researchers to
collect data from a large population. Main aim of the survey is to generalize
the findings. Aims: In this study we aim to identify the problems researchers
face during survey design, and mitigation strategies. Method: A literature
review as well as semi-structured interviews with nine software engineering
researchers were conducted to elicit their views on problems and mitigation
strategies. The researchers are all focused on empirical software engineering.
Results: We identified 24 problems and 65 strategies, structured according to
the survey research process. The most commonly discussed problem was sampling,
in particular the ability to obtain a sufficiently large sample. To improve
survey instrument design, evaluation and execution recommendations for question
formulation and survey pre-testing were given. The importance of involving
multiple researchers in the analysis of survey results was stressed.
Conclusions: The elicited problems and strategies may serve researchers during
the design of their studies. However, it was observed that some strategies were
conflicting. This shows that it is important to conduct a trade-off analysis
between strategies.

Object (RO), where an RO is defined as a resource that aggregates other
resources, e.g., datasets, software, spreadsheets, text, etc. We applied this
model to a case study where we analysed human metabolite variation by
workflows.

265,"  One of the main challenges for biomedical research lies in the
computer-assisted integrative study of large and increasingly complex
combinations of data in order to understand molecular mechanisms. The
preservation of the materials and methods of such computational experiments
with clear annotations is essential for understanding an experiment, and this
is increasingly recognized in the bioinformatics community. Our assumption is
that offering means of digital, structured aggregation and annotation of the
objects of an experiment will provide necessary meta-data for a scientist to
understand and recreate the results of an experiment. To support this we
explored a model for the semantic description of a workflow-centric Research
Object (RO), where an RO is defined as a resource that aggregates other

266,"  WorkingWiki is a software extension for the popular MediaWiki platform that
makes a wiki into a powerful environment for collaborating on
publication-quality manuscripts and software projects. Developed in Jonathan
Dushoff's theoretical biology lab at McMaster University and available as free
software, it allows wiki users to work together on anything that can be done by
using UNIX commands to transform textual ""source code"" into output. Researchers
can use it to collaborate on programs written in R, python, C, or any other
language, and there are special features to support easy work on LaTeX
documents. It develops the potential of the wiki medium to serve as a
combination collaborative text editor, development environment, revision
control system, and publishing platform. Its potential uses are open-ended -
its processing is controlled by makefiles that are straightforward to customize
- and its modular design is intended to allow parts of it to be adapted to
other purposes.

267,"  Glass published the first report on the assessment of systems and software
engineering scholars and institutions two decades ago. The ongoing, annual
survey of publications in this field provides fund managers, young scholars,
graduate students, etc. with useful information for different purposes.
However, the studies have been questioned by some critics because of a few
shortcomings of the evaluation method. It is actually very hard to reach a
widely recognized consensus on such an assessment of scholars and institutions.
This paper presents a module and automated method for assessment and trends
analysis in software engineering compared with the prior studies. To achieve a
more reasonable evaluation result, we take into consideration more high-quality
publications, the rank of each publication analyzed, and the different roles of
authors named on each paper in question. According to the 7638 papers published
in 36 publications from 2008 to 2013, the statistics of research subjects
roughly follow power laws, implying the interesting Matthew Effect. We then
identify the Top 20 scholars, institutions and countries or regions in terms of
a new evaluation rule based on the frequently-used one. The top-ranked scholar
is Mark Harman of the University College London, UK, the top-ranked institution
is the University of California, USA, and the top-ranked country is the USA.
Besides, we also show two levels of trend changes based on the EI
classification system and user-defined uncontrolled keywords, as well as
noteworthy scholars and institutions in a specific research area. We believe
that our results would provide a valuable insight for young scholars and
graduate students to seek possible potential collaborators and grasp the
popular research topics in software engineering.

312,"Engineering green software-intensive systems is critical in our drive towards a sustainable, smarter planet. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of software-intensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives.

400,"Sustainability management is one of the upcoming movements in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Communal and private organizations are interested in finding and using ""sustainable"" solutions and practices. But, there is a lack of available solutions and practices. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century also, software systems and their underlying business processes are ubiquitous and fundamental for most of the organizations of the industrial society. But, until now, sustainability is not considered by software system engineering. Hence, to support the transition to sustainability, one must have sustainability (aspects) integrated into the software systems and the underlying business processes. Consequently, in this paper a holistic approach is presented to support the complete life cycle of sustainable software system engineering. To realize such an approach, the sustainable business processes and sustainable software systems need to be aligned through the mapping of sustainability aspects considering their respective life cycles. This is important because software makes an important contribution to sustainable business processes and, the other way round, sustainable software only can be developed and maintained using the relevant business processes. Moreover, to realize sustainability aware software system engineering sustainability aspects must be integrated into the business processes life cycle and software system engineering life cycle. To this end, We suggest a conceptual model to integrate sustainability aspects in a business process modeling language.

413,"Sustainability management is one of the upcoming movements in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Communal and private organizations are interested in finding and using ""sustainable"" solutions and practices. But, there is a lack of available solutions and practices. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century also, software systems and their underlying business processes are ubiquitous and fundamental for most of the organizations of the industrial society. But, until now, sustainability is not considered by software system engineering. Hence, to support the transition to sustainability, one must have sustainability (aspects) integrated into the software systems and the underlying business processes. Consequently, in this paper a holistic approach is presented to support the complete life cycle of sustainable software system engineering. To realize such an approach, the sustainable business processes and sustainable software systems need to be aligned through the mapping of sustainability aspects considering their respective life cycles. This is important because software makes an important contribution to sustainable business processes and, the other way round, sustainable software only can be developed and maintained using the relevant business processes. Moreover, to realize sustainability aware software system engineering sustainability aspects must be integrated into the business processes life cycle and software system engineering life cycle. To this end, We suggest a conceptual model to integrate sustainability aspects in a business process modeling language. Also, to assist the stakeholder when modeling, designing, executing, and monitoring the business processes a process model will be presented developed. Furthermore, to integrate sustainability aspects in software engineering, sustainability needs to be considered in the different phases of the software development process: requirements specification, design, testing, and maintenance. Thus, we suggest a method to integrate - ustainability in software development.

Examples include e-waste from computers made obsolete due to software upgrades, and changes in the power demands of new versions of software. Sustainable software engineering aims to create reliable, long-lasting software that meets the needs of users while reducing environmental impacts. We conducted three related research efforts to explore this area. First, we investigated the extent to which users thought about the environmental impact of their software usage. Second, we created a tool called GreenTracker, which measures the energy consumption of software in order to raise awareness about the environmental impact of software usage. Finally, we explored the indirect environmental effects of software in order to understand how software affects sustainability beyond its own power consumption.

Green and sustainable software development aims to create green software that meets the needs of current and future users while minimizing its negative impacts on the environment and society. Green software development is getting attention in Global Software Engineering (GSE). Software development multi-sourcing vendor organizations have focused on the adaptation of green practices in software development projects. The objectives of this study are to identify and scrutinize a list of critical success factors (CSFs) for vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. The required data for conducting the study was taken, via systematic literature review (SLR) process, from a sample of 74 research papers. The SLR findings reveal that `green software design and efficient coding', `power-saving software strategies ', `low carbon emission throughout the software development process', `efficient resource utilization', `paperless communication', `filtration of requirements through green evaluator and e-waste management' are the critical factors to be implanted by vendors in the development of green and sustainable software.", Siffat Ullah Khan,2016,2016 7th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS),Salam2016,Libraries,1059-1062,IEEE,,Developing green and sustainable software: Success factors for vendors,e19a3cf91ad728b122bc606853c8c5d0

572,"Using Software Defined Network for the service upgrade of national R&E network requires replacing lots of legacy IP routers with SDN switches. Therefore, SDN migration should be carried out incrementally in order to reduce the instability of network service. A large ISP like Google prefers one by one migration of regional data centers that are scattered globally. Regional migration is appropriate only when the service architecture is very simple. For example, production of Google service is charged by Google data centers and consumption of them is the portion of remote users. But, in the case of national R&E network, service architecture is very complex because R&E network user, R&D experts, can be a service user and a service producer simultaneously when they do a collaborative research. Therefore, R&E network has to consider more factors in addition to region for incremental migration to SDN. In this paper, we suggest the detail framework and the practical methods of sustainable SDN migration that we had recently experienced during the softwarization of KREONET, Korea R&E network, and that were originally created as the solution of well-known problem of the legacy network, such as a last mile problem, inter-domain QoS exchange problem and so on.

605,"With the increasing role played by software in supporting our society, its sustainability and environmental impact have become major factors in the development and operation of software-intensive systems. Myths and beliefs hide the real truth behind Green IT: IT is energy-inefficient because software is developed to make it so - intentionally or not. But how far are we from being able to control software energy-efficiency? What makes software greener? How can we transform measuring software energy consumption in a general practice? What architectural design decisions will result in more sustainable systems? How can we ensure that new-generation software will be both cloud-ready and environmental-friendly? and How can we make evident the economic and social impact of developing software with 'energy in mind'?

However, today, there seems to be a gap between the variety of work in environmental, economic and sociological research for sustainable development and technology research used to support the same causes. Technologies still have not been used to contribute enough to sustainable development, particularly as they lack dynamic mechanisms for providing communities in a global context with decision-making systems that could help users to deal autonomously with daily problems they face in their environment.

855,"Context: More than a decade of empirical research into global software development has yielded a wealth of solutions to recurring problems. The Global Teaming Model is one example, organizing extensive empirical research into a cohesive process model for managing global software development projects. Problem: evidence shows that empirical research does not reach practitioners: software project managers do not read academic publications. Thus research results need to be cast in a form that is accessible to practitioners. Approach: We employ a two-pronged approach to address this problem. First, we translate research results into software process patterns, that describe a specific software development problem and an empirically derived and validated solution. Second, we enter the patterns into a knowledge based system that recommends patterns applicable to a software development project. Result: We used this approach to create a decision support system based on the Global Teaming Model. The result makes the sixty specific practices in the Global Teaming Model immediately accessible to managers and developers involved in Global Software Development. Also, the patternization of Global Teaming Model practices proved to be an efficient, low-overhead approach to translating research results into a practitioner-friendly format.

The Global Teaming Model is one example, organizing extensive empirical research into a cohesive process model for managing global software development projects. Problem: evidence shows that empirical research does not reach practitioners: software project managers do not read academic publications. Thus research results need to be cast in a form that is accessible to practitioners. Approach: We employ a two-pronged approach to address this problem.

The Global Teaming Model is one example, organizing extensive empirical research into a cohesive process model for managing global software development projects. Problem: evidence shows that empirical research does not reach practitioners: software project managers do not read academic publications. Thus research results need to be cast in a form that is accessible to practitioners. Approach: We employ a two-pronged approach to address this problem.

1170,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research (AirSTAR) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is a facility developed to study the flight dynamics of vehicles in emergency conditions, in support of aviation safety research. The system was upgraded to have its operational range significantly expanded, going beyond the line of sight of a ground-based pilot. A redesign of the airborne flight hardware was undertaken, as well as significant changes to the software base, in order to provide appropriate autonomous behavior in response to a number of potential failures and hazards. Ground hardware and system monitors were also upgraded to include redundant communication links, including ADS-B based position displays and an independent flight termination system. The design included both custom and commercially available avionics, combined to allow flexibility in flight experiment design while still benefiting from tested configurations in reversionary flight modes. A similar hierarchy was employed in the software architecture, to allow research codes to be tested, with a fallback to more thoroughly validated flight controls. As a remotely piloted facility, ground systems were also developed to ensure the flight modes and system state were communicated to ground operations personnel in real-time.

This is a serious issue that needs urgent attention. This article raises a number of points concerning quality, code review, and openness; development practices and training in scientific computing; career recognition of research software engineers; and sustainability models for funding scientific software.

Supply chain management that considers the flow of raw materials, products and information has become a focal issue in modern manufacturing and service systems. Supply chain management requires effective use of assets and information that has far reaching implications beyond satisfaction of customer demand, flow of goods, services or capital. Aggregate planning, a fundamental decision model in supply chain management, refers to the determination of production, inventory, capacity and labor usage levels in the medium term. Traditionally standard mathematical programming formulation is used to devise the aggregate plan so as to minimize the total cost of operations. However, this formulation is purely an economic model that does not include sustainability considerations. In this study, we revise the standard aggregate planning formulation to account for additional environmental and social criteria to incorporate triple bottom line consideration of sustainability. We show how these additional criteria can be appended to traditional cost accounting in order to address sustainability in aggregate planning. We analyze the revised models and interpret the results on a case study from real life that would be insightful for decision makers.

It has previously been shown that language production, performed simultaneously with a nonlinguistic task, involves sustained attention. Sustained attention concerns the ability to maintain alertness over time. Here, we aimed to replicate the previous finding by showing that individuals call upon sustained attention when they plan single noun phrases (e.g., ""the carrot"") and perform a manual arrow categorization task. In addition, we investigated whether speakers also recruit sustained attention when they produce conjoined noun phrases (e.g., ""the carrot and the bucket"") describing two pictures, that is, when both the first and second task are linguistic. We found that sustained attention correlated with the proportion of abnormally slow phrase-production responses. Individuals with poor sustained attention displayed a greater number of very slow responses than individuals with better sustained attention. Importantly, this relationship was obtained both for the production of single phrases while performing a nonlinguistic manual task, and the production of noun phrase conjunctions in referring to two spatially separated objects. Inhibition and updating abilities were also measured. These scores did not correlate with our measure of sustained attention, suggesting that sustained attention and executive control are distinct. Overall, the results suggest that planning conjoined noun phrases involves sustained attention, and that language production happens less automatically than has often been assumed.

Inhibition and updating abilities were also measured. These scores did not correlate with our measure of sustained attention, suggesting that sustained attention and executive control are distinct. Overall, the results suggest that planning conjoined noun phrases involves sustained attention, and that language production happens less automatically than has often been assumed.

It has previously been shown that language production, performed simultaneously with a nonlinguistic task, involves sustained attention. Sustained attention concerns the ability to maintain alertness over time. Here, we aimed to replicate the previous finding by showing that individuals call upon sustained attention when they plan single noun phrases (e.g., ""the carrot"") and perform a manual arrow categorization task. In addition, we investigated whether speakers also recruit sustained attention when they produce conjoined noun phrases (e.g., ""the carrot and the bucket"") describing two pictures, that is, when both the first and second task are linguistic. We found that sustained attention correlated with the proportion of abnormally slow phrase-production responses. Individuals with poor sustained attention displayed a greater number of very slow responses than individuals with better sustained attention. Importantly, this relationship was obtained both for the production of single phrases while performing a nonlinguistic manual task, and the production of noun phrase conjunctions in referring to two spatially separated objects. Inhibition and updating abilities were also measured. These scores did not correlate with our measure of sustained attention, suggesting that sustained attention and executive control are distinct.

The interplay between autophagy and intracellular pathogens is intricate as autophagy is an essential cellular response to fight against infections, whereas numerous microbes have developed strategies to escape this process or even exploit it to their own benefit. The fine tuned timing and/or selective molecular pathways involved in the induction of autophagy upon infections could be the cornerstone allowing cells to either control intracellular pathogens, or be invaded by them. We report here that measles virus infection induces successive autophagy signallings in permissive cells, via distinct and uncoupled molecular pathways. Immediately upon infection, attenuated measles virus induces a first transient wave of autophagy, via a pathway involving its cellular receptor CD46 and the scaffold protein GOPC. Soon after infection, a new autophagy signalling is initiated which requires viral replication and the expression of the non-structural measles virus protein C. Strikingly, this second autophagy signalling can be sustained overtime within infected cells, independently of the expression of C, but via a third autophagy input resulting from cell-cell fusion and the formation of syncytia. Whereas this sustained autophagy signalling leads to the autophagy degradation of cellular contents, viral proteins escape from degradation. Furthermore, this autophagy flux is ultimately exploited by measles virus to limit the death of infected cells and to improve viral particle formation. Whereas CD150 dependent virulent strains of measles virus are unable to induce the early CD46/GOPC dependent autophagy wave, they induce and exploit the late and sustained autophagy. Overall, our work describes distinct molecular pathways for an induction of self-beneficial sustained autophagy by measles virus.
Author Summary: Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal dependent degradative pathway for recycling of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Autophagy is also an essential cellular response to fight infection by destroying infectious pathogens trapped within autophagosomes and plays a key role in the induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Numerous viruses have evolved strategies to counteract autophagy in order to escape from degradation or/and to inhibit immune signals. The kinetic and molecular pathways involved in the induction of autophagy upon infections might determine if cells would be able to control pathogens or would be invaded by them. We showed that measles virus (MeV) infection induces successive autophagy signallings in cells via distinct molecular pathways. A first autophagy wave is induced by the engagement of the MeV cellular receptor CD46 and the scaffold protein GOPC. A second wave is initiated after viral replication by the expression of the non-structural MeV protein C and is sustained overtime within infected cells thanks to the formation of syncytia. This sustained autophagy is exploited by MeV to limit the death of infected cells and to improve viral particle formation.

Sustained attentional control is critical for everyday tasks and success in school and employment. Understanding gender differences in sustained attentional control, and their potential sources, is an important goal of psychology and neuroscience and of great relevance to society. We used a large web-based sample (n = 21,484, from testmybrain.org) to examine gender differences in sustained attentional control. Our sample included participants from 41 countries, allowing us to examine how gender differences in each country relate to national indices of gender equality. We found significant gender differences in certain aspects of sustained attentional control. Using indices of gender equality, we found that overall sustained attentional control performance was lower in countries with less equality and that there were greater gender differences in performance in countries with less equality. These findings suggest that creating sociocultural conditions which value women and men equally can improve a component of sustained attention and reduce gender disparities in cognition.

Using indices of gender equality, we found that overall sustained attentional control performance was lower in countries with less equality and that there were greater gender differences in performance in countries with less equality. These findings suggest that creating sociocultural conditions which value women and men equally can improve a component of sustained attention and reduce gender disparities in cognition.

Green material selection is a crucial step for the material industry to comprehensively improve material properties and promote sustainable development. However, because of the subjectivity and conflicting evaluation criteria in its process, green material selection, as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, has been a widespread concern to the relevant experts. Thus, this study proposes a hybrid MCDM approach that combines decision making and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), analytical network process (ANP), grey relational analysis (GRA) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to select the optimal green material for sustainability based on the product's needs. A nonlinear programming model with constraints was proposed to obtain the integrated closeness index. Subsequently, an empirical application of rubbish bins was used to illustrate the proposed method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis and a comparison with existing methods were employed to validate the accuracy and stability of the obtained final results. We found that this method provides a more accurate and effective decision support tool for alternative evaluation or strategy selection.

Current medically relevant metals for prosthetic reconstructions enjoy a relatively good success rate, but their performance drops significantly in patients with compromised health status, and post-surgical infections still remain an important challenge. To address these problems, different nanotechnology-based strategies have been exploited to create implantable metals with an enhanced bioactivity and antibacterial capacities. Among these, oxidative nanopatterning has emerged as a very effective approach to engender nanoporous surfaces that stimulate and guide the activity of adhering cells. The resulting nanoporosity is also attractive because it offers nanoconfined volumes that can be exploited to load bioactive compounds and modulate their release over time. Such extended elution is needed since a single exposure to growth factors and/or antibiotics, for instance, may not be adequate to further sustain bone regeneration and/or to counteract bacterial colonization. In this article, we assessed the capacities of nanoporous titanium surfaces generated by oxidative nanopatterning to provide controlled and sustained elution of proteins and antibiotic molecules. To this end, we have selected bovine serum albumin (BSA) and vancomycin to reflect commonly used compounds, and investigated their adsorption and elution by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet–visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that while the elution of albumin is not significantly affected by the nanoporosity, in the case of vancomycin, nanoporous surfaces provided an extended release. These findings were successively correlated to the establishment of interactions with the surface and physical-entrapment effects exerted by the nanopores, ultimately highlighting their synergistic contribution to the release profiles and thus their importance in the design of nanostructured eluting platforms for applications in medicine.

Online communities are becoming increasingly important as platforms for large-scale human cooperation. These communities allow users seeking and sharing professional skills to solve problems collaboratively. To investigate how users cooperate to complete a large number of knowledge-producing tasks, we analyze Stack Exchange, one of the largest question and answer systems in the world. We construct attention networks to model the growth of 110 communities in the Stack Exchange system and quantify individual answering strategies using the linking dynamics on attention networks. We identify two answering strategies. Strategy A aims at performing maintenance by doing simple tasks, whereas strategy B aims at investing time in doing challenging tasks. Both strategies are important: empirical evidence shows that strategy A decreases the median waiting time for answers and strategy B increases the acceptance rate of answers. In investigating the strategic persistence of users, we find that users tends to stick on the same strategy over time in a community, but switch from one strategy to the other across communities. This finding reveals the different sets of knowledge and skills between users. A balance between the population of users taking A and B strategies that approximates 2:1, is found to be optimal to the sustainable growth of communities.

        Resistance to insecticides has become a critical issue in pest management and it is particularly chronic in the control of human disease vectors. The gravity of this situation is being exacerbated since there has not been a new insecticide class produced for over twenty years. Reasoned strategies have been developed to limit resistance spread but have proven difficult to implement in the field. Here we propose a new conceptual strategy based on inhibitors that preferentially target mosquitoes already resistant to a currently used insecticide. Application of such inhibitors in rotation with the insecticide against which resistance has been selected initially is expected to restore vector control efficacy and reduce the odds of neo-resistance. We validated this strategy by screening for inhibitors of the G119S mutated acetylcholinesterase-1 (AChE1), which mediates insensitivity to the widely used organophosphates (OP) and carbamates (CX) insecticides. PyrimidineTrione Furan-substituted (PTF) compounds came out as best hits, acting biochemically as reversible and competitive inhibitors of mosquito AChE1 and preferentially inhibiting the mutated form, insensitive to OP and CX. PTF application in bioassays preferentially killed OP-resistant Culex pipiens and Anopheles gambiae larvae as a consequence of AChE1 inhibition. Modeling the evolution of frequencies of wild type and OP-insensitive AChE1 alleles in PTF-treated populations using the selectivity parameters estimated from bioassays predicts a rapid rise in the wild type allele frequency. This study identifies the first compound class that preferentially targets OP-resistant mosquitoes, thus restoring OP-susceptibility, which validates a new prospect of sustainable insecticide resistance management.

Organizations are increasingly using sustainability reports to inform their stakeholders and the public about their sustainability practices. We apply topic modelling to 9,514 sustainability reports published between 1999 and 2015 in order to identify common topics and, thus, the most common practices described in these reports. In particular, we identify forty-two topics that reflect sustainability and focus on the coverage and trends of economic, environmental, and social sustainability topics. Among the first to analyse such a large amount of data on organizations’ sustainability reporting, the paper serves as an example of how to apply natural language processing as a strategy of inquiry in sustainability research. The paper also derives from the data analysis ten propositions for future research and practice that are of immediate value for organizations and researchers.

Although research has demonstrated that children with specific language impairment (SLI) and reading disorder (RD) exhibit sustained attention deficits, no study has investigated sustained attention in children with speech sound disorder (SSD). Given the overlap of symptoms, such as phonological memory deficits, between these different language disorders (i.e., SLI, SSD and RD) and the relationships between working memory, attention and language processing, it is worthwhile to investigate whether deficits in sustained attention also occur in children with SSD. A total of 55 children (18 diagnosed with SSD (8.11±1.231) and 37 typically developing children (8.76±1.461)) were invited to participate in this study. Auditory and visual sustained-attention tasks were applied. Children with SSD performed worse on these tasks; they committed a greater number of auditory false alarms and exhibited a significant decline in performance over the course of the auditory detection task. The extent to which performance is related to auditory perceptual difficulties and probable working memory deficits is discussed. Further studies are needed to better understand the specific nature of these deficits and their clinical implications.

        At one level “sustained attention” is simply a description of a task demand. It is often used, however, in reference to a putatively unitary capacity to remain engaged in tasks that are lengthy, dull, repetitive and/or characterised by long intervals between relevant events. Deficits in sustained attention have been reported in a range of clinical conditions. Despite this, there is paucity of well-controlled human functional imaging evidence about regions commonly recruited during diverse sustained attention tasks. Here, for the first time, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity patterns as healthy volunteers performed two sustained attention tasks. The first, widely used in clinical assessment, required participants to count tones separated by long unpredictable intervals. This was contrasted with a control counting condition in which tones were presented at a brisk, regular rate. The second task was the Sustained Attention to Response Test (SART) in which participants responded to sequentially presented digits with the exception of a nominated infrequent no-go target. In the control condition, no-go trials were explicitly absent, removing the requirement to maintain a readiness to withhold responses. Although there were distinct patterns of activation associated with each task relative to its control, activity common to both tasks was found in the bilateral inferior frontal operculum, anterior cingulate, and bilateral premotor cortex. Although some researchers argue for a specific role of the inferior frontal operculum in inhibition, our results are consistent with recent findings of a more general attentional role for this area. The maintenance of a goal directed stance in the absence of strong environmental facilitation is challenging and this may underpin the sensitivity of sustained attention tasks to functional difficulties in a range of clinical groups.

        While a single approaching object is known to attract spatial attention, it is unknown how attention is directed when the background looms towards the observer as s/he moves forward in a quasi-stationary environment. In Experiment 1, we used a cued speeded discrimination task to quantify where and how spatial attention is directed towards the target superimposed onto a cloud of moving dots. We found that when the motion was expansive, attention was attracted towards the singular point of the optic flow (the focus of expansion, FOE) in a sustained fashion. The effects were less pronounced when the motion was contractive. The more ecologically valid the motion features became (e.g., temporal expansion of each dot, spatial depth structure implied by distribution of the size of the dots), the stronger the attentional effects. Further, the attentional effects were sustained over 1000 ms. Experiment 2 quantified these attentional effects using a change detection paradigm by zooming into or out of photographs of natural scenes. Spatial attention was attracted in a sustained manner such that change detection was facilitated or delayed depending on the location of the FOE only when the motion was expansive. Our results suggest that focal attention is strongly attracted towards singular points that signal the direction of forward ego-motion.

				Angiogenesis is a fundamental property of endothelium, yet not all endothelial cells display equivalent angiogenic responses; pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells undergo rapid angiogenesis when compared to endothelial cells isolated from conduit vessels. At present it is not clear how pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells fulfill the bioenergetic demands that are necessary to sustain such rapid blood vessel formation. We have previously established that pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells utilize aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP during growth, a process that requires the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A to convert pyruvate to lactate. Here, we test the hypothesis that lactate dehydrogenase A is required for pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells to sustain rapid angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, Tet-On and Tet-Off conditional expression systems were developed in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, where doxycycline is utilized to induce lactate dehydrogenase A shRNA expression. Expression of LDH-A shRNA induced a time-dependent decrease in LDH-A protein, which corresponded with a decrease in glucose consumption from the media, lactate production and cell growth; re-expression of LDH-A rescued each of these parameters. LDH-A silencing greatly reduced network formation on Matrigel in vitro, and decreased blood vessel formation in Matrigel in vivo. These findings demonstrate that LDH-A is critically important for sustaining the rapid angiogenesis of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.

Primates are frequently hunted in Amazonia. Assessing the sustainability of hunting is essential to conservation planning. The most-used sustainability model, the ‘Production Model’, and more recent spatial models, rely on basic reproductive parameters for accuracy. These parameters are often crudely estimated. To date, parameters used for the Amazon’s most-hunted primate, the woolly monkey (Lagothrix spp.), come from captive populations in the 1960s, when captive births were rare. Furthermore, woolly monkeys have since been split into five species. We provide reproductive parameters calculated by examining the reproductive organs of female Poeppig’s woolly monkeys (Lagothrix poeppigii), collected by hunters as part of their normal subsistence activity. Production was 0.48–0.54 young per female per year, and an interbirth interval of 22.3 to 25.2 months, similar to parameters from captive populations. However, breeding was seasonal, which imposes limits on the maximum reproductive rate attainable. We recommend the use of spatial models over the Production Model, since they are less sensitive to error in estimated reproductive rates. Further refinements to reproductive parameters are needed for most primate taxa. Methods like ours verify the suitability of captive reproductive rates for sustainability analysis and population modelling for populations under differing conditions of hunting pressure and seasonality. Without such research, population modelling is based largely on guesswork.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over age 65 in industrialized nations. Intravitreous injection of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) therapies, such as ranibizumab (trade name: Lucentis), provides an effective treatment option for neovascular AMD. We have developed an improved coaxial electrospray (CES) process to encapsulate ranibizumab in poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microparticles (MPs) for intravitreous injection and sustained drug release. This microencapsulation process is advantageous for maintaining the stability of the coaxial cone-jet configurations and producing drug-loaded MPs with as high as 70% encapsulation rate and minimal loss of bioactivitiy. The utility of this emerging process in intravitreous drug delivery has been demonstrated in both benchtop and in vivo experiments. The benchtop test simulates ocular drug release using PLGA MPs encapsulating a model drug. The in vivo experiment evaluates the inflammation and retinal cell death after intravitreal injection of the MPs in a chick model. The experimental results show that the drug-load MPs are able to facilitate sustained drug release for longer than one month. No significant long term microglia reaction or cell death is observed after intravitreal injection of 200 μg MPs. The present study demonstrates the technical feasibility of using the improved CES process to encapsulate water-soluble drugs at a high concentration for sustained release of anti-VEGF therapy.

        The cochlear implant provides auditory cues to profoundly deaf patients by electrically stimulating the residual spiral ganglion neurons. These neurons, however, undergo progressive degeneration after hearing loss, marked initially by peripheral fibre retraction and ultimately culminating in cell death. This research aims to use gene therapy techniques to both hold and reverse this degeneration by providing a sustained and localised source of neurotrophins to the deafened cochlea. Adenoviral vectors containing green fluorescent protein, with or without neurotrophin-3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor, were injected into the lower basal turn of scala media of guinea pigs ototoxically deafened one week prior to intervention. This single injection resulted in localised and sustained gene expression, principally in the supporting cells within the organ of Corti. Guinea pigs treated with adenoviral neurotrophin-gene therapy had greater neuronal survival compared to contralateral non-treated cochleae when examined at 7 and 11 weeks post injection. Moreover; there was evidence of directed peripheral fibre regrowth towards cells expressing neurotrophin genes after both treatment periods. These data suggest that neurotrophin-gene therapy can provide sustained protection of spiral ganglion neurons and peripheral fibres after hearing loss.

        We reconstructed cellular motility in vitro from individual proteins to investigate how actin filaments are organized at the leading edge. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of actin filaments, we tested how profilin, Arp2/3, and capping protein (CP) function together to propel thin glass nanofibers or beads coated with N-WASP WCA domains. Thin nanofibers produced wide comet tails that showed more structural variation in actin filament organization than did bead substrates. During sustained motility, physiological concentrations of Mg2+ generated actin filament bundles that processively attached to the nanofiber. Reduction of total Mg2+ abolished particle motility and actin attachment to the particle surface without affecting actin polymerization, Arp2/3 nucleation, or filament capping. Analysis of similar motility of microspheres showed that loss of filament bundling did not affect actin shell formation or symmetry breaking but eliminated sustained attachments between the comet tail and the particle surface. Addition of Mg2+, Lys-Lys2+, or fascin restored both comet tail attachment and sustained particle motility in low Mg2+ buffers. TIRF microscopic analysis of filaments captured by WCA-coated beads in the absence of Arp2/3, profilin, and CP showed that filament bundling by polycation or fascin addition increased barbed end capture by WCA domains. We propose a model in which CP directs barbed ends toward the leading edge and polycation-induced filament bundling sustains processive barbed end attachment to the leading edge.

1659,"Introduction: Happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability, as recommended in the Sustainable Development Goals; however, little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities. To fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Methods: Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. This study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. Results: The results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. As expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. However, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. Conclusions: The disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. Several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. For example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. Moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions.

1660,"Background: The introduction of the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) in Ghana in 2003 significantly contributed to improved health services utilization and health outcomes. However, stagnating active membership, reports of poor quality health care rendered to NHIS-insured clients and cost escalations have raised concerns on the operational and financial sustainability of the scheme. This paper reviewed peer reviewed articles and grey literature on the sustainability challenges and prospects of the NHIS in Ghana. Methods: Electronic search was done for literature published between 2003–2016 on the NHIS and its sustainability in Ghana. A total of 66 publications relevant to health insurance in Ghana and other developing countries were retrieved from Cochrane, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Googlescholar for initial screening. Out of this number, 31 eligible peer reviewed articles were selected for final review based on specific relevance to the Ghanaian context. Results: Ability of the NHIS to continue its operations in Ghana is threatened financially and operationally by factors such as: cost escalation, possible political interference, inadequate technical capacity, spatial distribution of health facilities and health workers, inadequate monitoring mechanisms, broad benefits package, large exemption groups, inadequate client education, and limited community engagement. Moreover, poor quality care in NHIS-accredited health facilities potentially reduces clients’ trust in the scheme and consequently decreases (re)enrolment rates. These sustainability challenges were reviewed and discussed in this paper. Conclusions: The NHIS continues to play a critical role towards attaining universal health coverage in Ghana albeit confronted by challenges that could potentially collapse the scheme.

This paper reviewed peer reviewed articles and grey literature on the sustainability challenges and prospects of the NHIS in Ghana. Methods: Electronic search was done for literature published between 2003–2016 on the NHIS and its sustainability in Ghana. A total of 66 publications relevant to health insurance in Ghana and other developing countries were retrieved from Cochrane, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Googlescholar for initial screening. Out of this number, 31 eligible peer reviewed articles were selected for final review based on specific relevance to the Ghanaian context. Results: Ability of the NHIS to continue its operations in Ghana is threatened financially and operationally by factors such as: cost escalation, possible political interference, inadequate technical capacity, spatial distribution of health facilities and health workers, inadequate monitoring mechanisms, broad benefits package, large exemption groups, inadequate client education, and limited community engagement. Moreover, poor quality care in NHIS-accredited health facilities potentially reduces clients’ trust in the scheme and consequently decreases (re)enrolment rates. These sustainability challenges were reviewed and discussed in this paper. Conclusions: The NHIS continues to play a critical role towards attaining universal health coverage in Ghana albeit confronted by challenges that could potentially collapse the scheme. Averting this possible predicament will largely depend on concerted efforts of key stakeholders such as health insurance managers, service providers, insurance subscribers, policy makers and political actors.

Childhood maltreatment is associated with adverse affective and cognitive consequences including impaired emotion processing, inhibition and attention. However, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in childhood maltreatment have examined emotion processing, while very few studies have tested the neurofunctional substrates of cognitive functions and none of attention. This study investigated the association between severe childhood abuse and fMRI brain activation during a parametric sustained attention task with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention in 21 medication-naïve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse controlling for psychiatric comorbidities by including 19 psychiatric controls matched for psychiatric diagnoses, and 27 healthy controls. Behaviorally, the participants exposed to childhood abuse showed increased omission errors in the task which correlated positively trend-wise with the duration of their abuse. Neurofunctionally, the participants with a history of childhood abuse, but not the psychiatric controls, displayed significantly reduced activation relative to the healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition only in typical attention regions including left inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and temporal areas. We therefore show for the first time that severe childhood abuse is associated with neurofunctional abnormalities in key ventral frontal-temporal sustained attention regions. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments for victims of childhood abuse.

The design of bioactive three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds is a major focus in bone tissue engineering. Incorporation of growth factors into bioprinted scaffolds offers many new possibilities regarding both biological and architectural properties of the scaffolds. This study investigates whether the sustained release of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) influences osteogenicity of tissue engineered bioprinted constructs. BMP-2 loaded on gelatin microparticles (GMPs) was used as a sustained release system, which was dispersed in hydrogel-based constructs and compared to direct inclusion of BMP-2 in alginate or control GMPs. The constructs were supplemented with goat multipotent stromal cells (gMSCs) and biphasic calcium phosphate to study osteogenic differentiation and bone formation respectively. BMP-2 release kinetics and bioactivity showed continuous release for three weeks coinciding with osteogenicity. Osteogenic differentiation and bone formation of bioprinted GMP containing constructs were investigated after subcutaneous implantation in mice or rats. BMP-2 significantly increased bone formation, which was not influenced by the release timing. We showed that 3D printing of controlled release particles is feasible and that the released BMP-2 directs osteogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

HoxA5 is expressed in quiescent endothelial cells (EC), but absent in activated angiogenic EC. To examine the efficacy of targeting HoxA5 therapeutically to quell pathologic or tumor angiogenesis, we generated an inducible, transgenic mouse model of sustained HoxA5 expression in ECs. During pathologic angiogenesis, sustained HoxA5 regulates expression several angiogenic effector molecules, notably increased expression of TSP-2 and reduced expression of VEGF, thus leading to inhibition of pathological angiogenesis in tissues. To evaluate if this impressive reduction of vascularization could also impact tumor angiogenesis, HoxA5 mice were bred with a mouse model of de novo squamous carcinogenesis, e.g., K14-HPV16 mice. Activation of EC-HoxA5 significantly reduced infiltration by mast cells into neoplastic skin, an early hallmark of progression to dysplasia, reduced angiogenic vasculature, and blunted characteristics of tumor progression. To evaluate HoxA5 as a therapeutic, topical application of a HoxA5 transgene onto early neoplastic skin of K14-HPV16 mice similarly resulted in a significant impairment of angiogenic vasculature and progression to dysplasia to a similar extent as observed with genetic delivery of HoxA5. Together these data indicate that HoxA5 represents a novel molecule for restricting pathological and tumorigenic angiogenesis.

It has been suggested that dopamine (DA) represents reward-prediction-error (RPE) defined in reinforcement learning and therefore DA responds to unpredicted but not predicted reward. However, recent studies have found DA response sustained towards predictable reward in tasks involving self-paced behavior, and suggested that this response represents a motivational signal. We have previously shown that RPE can sustain if there is decay/forgetting of learned-values, which can be implemented as decay of synaptic strengths storing learned-values. This account, however, did not explain the suggested link between tonic/sustained DA and motivation. In the present work, we explored the motivational effects of the value-decay in self-paced approach behavior, modeled as a series of ‘Go’ or ‘No-Go’ selections towards a goal. Through simulations, we found that the value-decay can enhance motivation, specifically, facilitate fast goal-reaching, albeit counterintuitively. Mathematical analyses revealed that underlying potential mechanisms are twofold: (1) decay-induced sustained RPE creates a gradient of ‘Go’ values towards a goal, and (2) value-contrasts between ‘Go’ and ‘No-Go’ are generated because while chosen values are continually updated, unchosen values simply decay. Our model provides potential explanations for the key experimental findings that suggest DA's roles in motivation: (i) slowdown of behavior by post-training blockade of DA signaling, (ii) observations that DA blockade severely impairs effortful actions to obtain rewards while largely sparing seeking of easily obtainable rewards, and (iii) relationships between the reward amount, the level of motivation reflected in the speed of behavior, and the average level of DA. These results indicate that reinforcement learning with value-decay, or forgetting, provides a parsimonious mechanistic account for the DA's roles in value-learning and motivation. Our results also suggest that when biological systems for value-learning are active even though learning has apparently converged, the systems might be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, where learning and forgetting are balanced.
Author Summary: Dopamine (DA) has been suggested to have two reward-related roles: (1) representing reward-prediction-error (RPE), and (2) providing motivational drive. Role(1) is based on the physiological results that DA responds to unpredicted but not predicted reward, whereas role(2) is supported by the pharmacological results that blockade of DA signaling causes motivational impairments such as slowdown of self-paced behavior. So far, these two roles are considered to be played by two different temporal patterns of DA signals: role(1) by phasic signals and role(2) by tonic/sustained signals. However, recent studies have found sustained DA signals with features indicative of both roles (1) and (2), complicating this picture. Meanwhile, whereas synaptic/circuit mechanisms for role(1), i.e., how RPE is calculated in the upstream of DA neurons and how RPE-dependent update of learned-values occurs through DA-dependent synaptic plasticity, have now become clarified, mechanisms for role(2) remain unclear. In this work, we modeled self-paced behavior by a series of ‘Go’ or ‘No-Go’ selections in the framework of reinforcement-learning assuming DA's role(1), and demonstrated that incorporation of decay/forgetting of learned-values, which is presumably implemented as decay of synaptic strengths storing learned-values, provides a potential unified mechanistic account for the DA's two roles, together with its various temporal patterns.

Our model provides potential explanations for the key experimental findings that suggest DA's roles in motivation: (i) slowdown of behavior by post-training blockade of DA signaling, (ii) observations that DA blockade severely impairs effortful actions to obtain rewards while largely sparing seeking of easily obtainable rewards, and (iii) relationships between the reward amount, the level of motivation reflected in the speed of behavior, and the average level of DA. These results indicate that reinforcement learning with value-decay, or forgetting, provides a parsimonious mechanistic account for the DA's roles in value-learning and motivation. Our results also suggest that when biological systems for value-learning are active even though learning has apparently converged, the systems might be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, where learning and forgetting are balanced.
Author Summary: Dopamine (DA) has been suggested to have two reward-related roles: (1) representing reward-prediction-error (RPE), and (2) providing motivational drive. Role(1) is based on the physiological results that DA responds to unpredicted but not predicted reward, whereas role(2) is supported by the pharmacological results that blockade of DA signaling causes motivational impairments such as slowdown of self-paced behavior. So far, these two roles are considered to be played by two different temporal patterns of DA signals: role(1) by phasic signals and role(2) by tonic/sustained signals. However, recent studies have found sustained DA signals with features indicative of both roles (1) and (2), complicating this picture. Meanwhile, whereas synaptic/circuit mechanisms for role(1), i.e., how RPE is calculated in the upstream of DA neurons and how RPE-dependent update of learned-values occurs through DA-dependent synaptic plasticity, have now become clarified, mechanisms for role(2) remain unclear. In this work, we modeled self-paced behavior by a series of ‘Go’ or ‘No-Go’ selections in the framework of reinforcement-learning assuming DA's role(1), and demonstrated that incorporation of decay/forgetting of learned-values, which is presumably implemented as decay of synaptic strengths storing learned-values, provides a potential unified mechanistic account for the DA's two roles, together with its various temporal patterns.

A clean and sustainable deicing additive was prepared via the adsorption of acetate anions (Ac-) by magnesium (Mg) and aluminum (Al) calcined layered double hydroxide (Mg/Al-CLDH). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectrums proved that Ac- had intercalated into LDH structure. X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that the intercalation spacing and platelet thickness of Mg and Al layered double hydroxide containing Ac- anions (Mg/Al-Ac- LDH) had been enlarged due to substitution of divalent CO32- anions by a larger quantity of monovalent Ac– anions. Differential scanning calorimetry tests testified that the insoluble Mg2/Al-Ac- LDH evidently decreased the freeze point (FP) of water to -10.68°C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that the Ac- were strongly confined by the metal layers of LDHs. FP test of asphalt mixtures confirmed that Mg/Al-Ac- LDHs reduced FP to -5.5°C.

The development of antibacterial drugs to overcome various pathogenic species, which inhabit the oral cavity, faces several challenges, such as salivary flow and enzymatic activity that restrict dosage retention. Owing to their amphipathic nature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) serve as the first line of defense of the innate immune system. The ability to synthesize different types of AMPs enables exploitation of their advantages as alternatives to antibiotics. Sustained release of AMPs incorporated in biodegradable polymers can be advantageous in maintaining high levels of the peptides. In this study, four potent ultra-short lipopeptides, conjugated to an aliphatic acid chain (16C) were incorporated in two different biodegradable polymers: poly (lactic acid co castor oil) (PLACO) and ricinoleic acid-based poly (ester-anhydride) (P(SA-RA)) for sustained release. The lipopeptide and polymer formulations were tested for antibacterial activity during one week, by turbidometric measurements of bacterial outgrowth, anti-biofilm activity by live/dead staining, biocompatibility by hemolysis and XTT colorimetric assays, mode of action by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and release profile by a fluorometric assay. The results show that an antibacterial and anti-biofilm effect, as well as membrane disruption, can be achieved by the use of a formulation of lipopeptide incorporated in biodegradable polymer.

Auditory selective attention plays an essential role for identifying sounds of interest in a scene, but the neural underpinnings are still incompletely understood. Recent findings demonstrate that neural activity that is time-locked to a particular amplitude-modulation (AM) is enhanced in the auditory cortex when the modulated stream of sounds is selectively attended to under sensory competition with other streams. However, the target sounds used in the previous studies differed not only in their AM, but also in other sound features, such as carrier frequency or location. Thus, it remains uncertain whether the observed enhancements reflect AM-selective attention. The present study aims at dissociating the effect of AM frequency on response enhancement in auditory cortex by using an ongoing auditory stimulus that contains two competing targets differing exclusively in their AM frequency. Electroencephalography results showed a sustained response enhancement for auditory attention compared to visual attention, but not for AM-selective attention (attended AM frequency vs. ignored AM frequency). In contrast, the response to the ignored AM frequency was enhanced, although a brief trend toward response enhancement occurred during the initial 15 s. Together with the previous findings, these observations indicate that selective enhancement of attended AMs in auditory cortex is adaptive under sustained AM-selective attention. This finding has implications for our understanding of cortical mechanisms for feature-based attentional gain control.

YopM, whose deletion in enteropathogenic yersiniae results in a dramatic loss of virulence, has previously been shown to form a complex with and activate the multifunctional kinases PKN2 and RSK1 in transfected cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a near physiological approach with double-affinity-tagged YopM being translocated into the macrophage cell line J774A.1 via the natural type three secretion system of Yersinia we verified the interaction of YopM with PKN2 and RSK1 and detected association with additional PKN and RSK isoforms. In transfected and infected cells YopM induced sustained phosphorylation of RSK at its activation sites serine-380 and serine-221 even in the absence of signalling from its upstream kinase ERK1/2, suggesting inhibition of dephosphorylation. ATP-depletion and in vitro assays using purified components directly confirmed that YopM shields RSK isoforms from phosphatase activity towards serines 380 and 221. Conclusions/Significance: Our study suggests that during Yersinia infection YopM induces sustained activation of RSK by blocking dephosphorylation of its activatory phosphorylation sites. This may represent a novel mode of action of a bacterial virulence factor.

1709,"Purpose: This study sought to investigate the influence of phoria adaptation on convergence peak velocity from responses located at different initial vergence positions. Methods: Symmetrical 4° convergence step responses and near dissociated phoria (measured at 40 cm from the subject's midline) were recorded from six subjects with normal binocular vision using an infrared limbus tracking system with a haploscope. Two different sustained fixations (1° and 16° convergent rotation along the subject's midline) were used to study whether phoria had an influence on the peak velocity of convergence responses located at two initial vergence positions (1° or ‘far’ steps and 12° or ‘near’ steps). Results: Phoria was significantly adapted after a sustained fixation task at near (16°) and far (1°) (p<0.002). A repeated measures ANOVA showed that convergence far steps were significantly faster than the near steps (p<0.03). When comparing convergence steps with the same initial vergence position, steps measured after near phoria adaptation were faster than responses after far adaptation (p<0.02). A regression analysis demonstrated that the change in phoria and the change in convergence peak velocity were significantly correlated for the far convergence steps (r = 0.97, p = 0.001). A weaker correlation was observed for the near convergence steps (r = 0.59, p = 0.20). Conclusion: As a result of sustained fixation, phoria was adapted and the peak velocity of the near and far convergence steps was modified. This study has clinical considerations since prisms, which evoke phoria adaptation, can be prescribed to help alleviate visual discomfort. Future investigations should include a systematic study of how prisms may influence convergence and divergence eye movements for those prescribed with prisms within their spectacles. ",Eun H.

Tropical forests are experiencing a growing fire problem driven by climatic change, agricultural expansion and forest degradation. Protected areas are an important feature of forest protection strategies, and sustainable use reserves (SURs) may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management. However, the use of fire in swidden agriculture, and other forms of land management, may be undermining the effectiveness of SURs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals. We analyse MODIS derived hot pixels, TRMM rainfall data, Terra-Class land cover data, socio-ecological data from the Brazilian agro-census and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of SURs reduces fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we ask (1) a. Is SUR location (i.e., de facto) or (1) b. designation (i.e. de jure) the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires?, and (2), Does SUR creation affect fire management (i.e., the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall)? We demonstrate that pre-protection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance. We show that reserve creation had no discernible impact on fire density, and that fires were less prevalent in SURs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness, rather than their status de jure. In addition, the timing of fires in relation to rainfall, indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law, did not improve following SUR creation. These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats.

These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats.

As the scientific enterprise has grown in size and diversity, we need empirical evidence on the research process to test and apply interventions that make it more efficient and its results more reliable. Meta-research is an evolving scientific discipline that aims to evaluate and improve research practices. It includes thematic areas of methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives (how to do, report, verify, correct, and reward science). Much work is already done in this growing field, but efforts to-date are fragmented. We provide a map of ongoing efforts and discuss plans for connecting the multiple meta-research efforts across science worldwide.

Meta-research is the science of evaluating how to do, report, verify, correct, and reward scientific investigation. Many initiatives focus on these important issues, and more can be done.

A survey in the United States revealed that an alarmingly large percentage of university psychologists admitted having used questionable research practices that can contaminate the research literature with false positive and biased findings. We conducted a replication of this study among Italian research psychologists to investigate whether these findings generalize to other countries. All the original materials were translated into Italian, and members of the Italian Association of Psychology were invited to participate via an online survey. The percentages of Italian psychologists who admitted to having used ten questionable research practices were similar to the results obtained in the United States although there were small but significant differences in self-admission rates for some QRPs. Nearly all researchers (88%) admitted using at least one of the practices, and researchers generally considered a practice possibly defensible if they admitted using it, but Italian researchers were much less likely than US researchers to consider a practice defensible. Participants’ estimates of the percentage of researchers who have used these practices were greater than the self-admission rates, and participants estimated that researchers would be unlikely to admit it. In written responses, participants argued that some of these practices are not questionable and they have used some practices because reviewers and journals demand it. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this study, and a related study conducted in Germany suggest that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes.

In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and dynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals of the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the identifiers ""HIV/AIDS"", ""Human Immunodeficiency Virus"", “HIV-1” and ""Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics. Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the patient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular structures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the development of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the disease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts occurred in successive ""waves"" over the time which suggest a transition in the paradigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in elements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but also by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred between 1993 and 1995.

    Clinical research has become increasingly globalized, but the extent of globalization has not been assessed. To describe the globalization of clinical research, we used all (n = 13,208) multinational trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov to analyzed geographic connections among individual countries. Our findings indicate that 95% (n = 185) of all countries worldwide have participated in multinational clinical research. Growth in the globalization of clinical research peaked in 2009, suggesting that the global infrastructure that supports clinical research might have reached its maximum capacity. Growth in the globalization of clinical research is attributable to increased involvement of non-traditional markets, particularly in South America and Asia. Nevertheless, Europe is the most highly interconnected geographic region (60.64% of global connections), and collectively, Europe, North America, and Asia comprise more than 85% of all global connections. Therefore, while the expansion of clinical trials into non-traditional markets has increased over the last 20 years and connects countries across the globe, traditional markets still dominate multinational clinical research, which appears to have reached a maximum global capacity.

Compared to research reports with government funding, those not acknowledging any funding sources, followed by studies with University/hospital funding were more likely to receive neutral vs positive quality ratings, OR = 1.85, P <0.001 and OR = 1.54, P<0.001, respectively and those that did not report funding were more likely to receive negative quality ratings (OR = 4.97, P<0.001). After controlling for research design, industry funded research reports were no more likely to receive a neutral or negative quality rating than those funded by government sources. Conclusion: Research report quality cannot be accurately predicted from the funding source after controlling for research design. Continued vigilance to evaluate the quality of all research regardless of the funding source and to further understand other factors that affect quality ratings are warranted.

Impactful academic research plays a stellar role in society, pressing to ask the question of how one measures the impact created by different areas of academic research. Measuring the societal, cultural, economic and scientific impact of research is currently the priority of the National Science Foundation, European Commission and several research funding agencies. The recently concluded United Kingdom’s national research quality exercise, the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014, which piloted impact assessment as part of the overall evaluation offers a lens to view how impact of research in different disciplines can be measured. Overall research quality was assessed through quality of outputs, ‘impact’ and research environment. We performed two studies using the REF 2014 as a case study. The first study on 363 Impact Case Studies (ICSs) submitted in 5 research areas (UoAs) reveals that, in general, the impact scores were constructed upon a combination of factors i.e. quantity of quartile-one (Q1) publications, quantity and value of grants/income, number of researchers stated in the ICSs, spin-offs created, discoveries/patents and presentation of esteem data, informing researchers/ academics of the factors to consider in order to achieve a better impact score in research impact assessments. However, there were differences among disciplines in terms of the role played by the factors in achieving their overall scores for the ICSs. The outcome of this study is thus a set of impact indicators, and their relationship with the overall score of impact of research in different disciplines as determined in REF2014, which would in the first instance provide some answers to impact measures that would be useful for researchers in different disciplines. The second study extracts the general themes of impact reported by universities by performing a word frequency analysis in all the ICSs submitted in the five chosen research areas, which were substantially varied owing to their fields.

The thesis presented here is that biomedical research is based on the trusted exchange of services. That exchange would be conducted more efficiently if the trusted software platforms to exchange those services, if they exist, were more integrated. While simpler and narrower in scope than the services governing biomedical research, comparison to existing internet-based platforms, like Airbnb, can be informative. We illustrate how the analogy to internet-based platforms works and does not work and introduce The Commons, under active development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and elsewhere, as an example of the move towards platforms for research.

Postdoctoral training is a typical step in the course of an academic career, but very little is known about postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) working in the UK. This study used an online survey to explore, for the first time, relevant environmental factors which may be linked to the research output of PDRs in terms of the number of peer-reviewed articles per year of PDR employment. The findings showed reliable links between the research output and research institutions, time spent as PDR, and parental education, whereas no clear links were observed between PDRs' output and research area, nationality, gender, number of siblings, or work environment. PDRs based in universities tended to publish, on average, more than the ones based in research centres. PDRs with children tended to stay longer in postdoctoral employment than PDRs without children. Moreover, research output tended to be higher in PDRs with fathers educated at secondary or higher level. The work environment did not affect output directly, but about 1/5 of PDRs were not satisfied with their job or institutional support and about 2/3 of them perceived their job prospects as “difficult”. The results from this exploratory study raise important questions, which need to be addressed in large-scale studies in order to understand (and monitor) how PDRs' family and work environment interact with their research output—an essential step given the crucial role of PDRs in research and development in the country.

Given limited funds for research and widespread degradation of ecosystems, environmental scientists should geographically target their studies where they will be most effective. However, in academic areas such as conservation and natural resource management there is often a mismatch between the geographic foci of research effort/funding and research needs. The former frequently being focused in the developed world while the latter is greater in the biodiverse countries of the Global South. Here, we adopt a bibliometric approach to test this hypothesis using research on artisanal fisheries. Such fisheries occur throughout the world, but are especially prominent in developing countries where they are important for supporting local livelihoods, food security and poverty alleviation. Moreover, most artisanal fisheries in the Global South are unregulated and unmonitored and are in urgent need of science-based management to ensure future sustainability. Our results indicate that, as predicted, global research networks and centres of knowledge production are predominantly located in developed countries, indicating a global mismatch between research needs and capacity.

Big changes to the way in which research funding is allocated to UK universities were brought about in the Research Excellence Framework (REF), overseen by the Higher Education Funding Council, England. Replacing the earlier Research Assessment Exercise, the purpose of the REF was to assess the quality and reach of research in UK universities–and allocate funding accordingly. For the first time, this included an assessment of research ‘impact’, accounting for 20% of the funding allocation. In this article we use a text mining technique to investigate the interpretations of impact put forward via impact case studies in the REF process. We find that institutions have developed a diverse interpretation of impact, ranging from commercial applications to public and cultural engagement activities. These interpretations of impact vary from discipline to discipline and between institutions, with more broad-based institutions depicting a greater variety of impacts. Comparing the interpretations with the score given by REF, we found no evidence of one particular interpretation being more highly rewarded than another. Importantly, we also found a positive correlation between impact score and [overall research] quality score, suggesting that impact is not being achieved at the expense of research excellence.

Professional codes of ethics are social contracts among members of a professional group, which aim to instigate, encourage and nurture ethical behaviour and prevent professional misconduct, including research and publication. Despite the existence of codes of ethics, research misconduct remains a serious problem. A survey of codes of ethics from 795 professional organizations from the Illinois Institute of Technology’s Codes of Ethics Collection showed that 182 of them (23%) used research integrity and research ethics terminology in their codes, with differences across disciplines: while the terminology was common in professional organizations in social sciences (82%), mental health (71%), sciences (61%), other organizations had no statements (construction trades, fraternal social organizations, real estate) or a few of them (management, media, engineering). A subsample of 158 professional organizations we judged to be directly involved in research significantly more often had statements on research integrity/ethics terminology than the whole sample: an average of 10.4% of organizations with a statement (95% CI = 10.4-23-5%) on any of the 27 research integrity/ethics terms compared to 3.3% (95% CI = 2.1–4.6%), respectively (P<0.001). Overall, 62% of all statements addressing research integrity/ethics concepts used prescriptive language in describing the standard of practice.

Professional codes of ethics are social contracts among members of a professional group, which aim to instigate, encourage and nurture ethical behaviour and prevent professional misconduct, including research and publication. Despite the existence of codes of ethics, research misconduct remains a serious problem. A survey of codes of ethics from 795 professional organizations from the Illinois Institute of Technology’s Codes of Ethics Collection showed that 182 of them (23%) used research integrity and research ethics terminology in their codes, with differences across disciplines: while the terminology was common in professional organizations in social sciences (82%), mental health (71%), sciences (61%), other organizations had no statements (construction trades, fraternal social organizations, real estate) or a few of them (management, media, engineering). A subsample of 158 professional organizations we judged to be directly involved in research significantly more often had statements on research integrity/ethics terminology than the whole sample: an average of 10.4% of organizations with a statement (95% CI = 10.4-23-5%) on any of the 27 research integrity/ethics terms compared to 3.3% (95% CI = 2.1–4.6%), respectively (P<0.001). Overall, 62% of all statements addressing research integrity/ethics concepts used prescriptive language in describing the standard of practice. Professional organizations should define research integrity and research ethics issues in their ethics codes and collaborate within and across disciplines to adequately address responsible conduct of research and meet contemporary needs of their communities.

To gauge the current commitment to scientific research in the United States of America (US), we compared federal research funding (FRF) with the US gross domestic product (GDP) and industry research spending during the past six decades. In order to address the recent globalization of scientific research, we also focused on four key indicators of research activities: research and development (R&D) funding, total science and engineering doctoral degrees, patents, and scientific publications. We compared these indicators across three major population and economic regions: the US, the European Union (EU) and the People's Republic of China (China) over the past decade. We discovered a number of interesting trends with direct relevance for science policy. The level of US FRF has varied between 0.2% and 0.6% of the GDP during the last six decades. Since the 1960s, the US FRF contribution has fallen from twice that of industrial research funding to roughly equal. Also, in the last two decades, the portion of the US government R&D spending devoted to research has increased. Although well below the US and the EU in overall funding, the current growth rate for R&D funding in China greatly exceeds that of both. Finally, the EU currently produces more science and engineering doctoral graduates and scientific publications than the US in absolute terms, but not per capita. This study's aim is to facilitate a serious discussion of key questions by the research community and federal policy makers. In particular, our results raise two questions with respect to: a) the increasing globalization of science: “What role is the US playing now, and what role will it play in the future of international science?”; and b) the ability to produce beneficial innovations for society: “How will the US continue to foster its strengths?”

Although well below the US and the EU in overall funding, the current growth rate for R&D funding in China greatly exceeds that of both. Finally, the EU currently produces more science and engineering doctoral graduates and scientific publications than the US in absolute terms, but not per capita. This study's aim is to facilitate a serious discussion of key questions by the research community and federal policy makers. In particular, our results raise two questions with respect to: a) the increasing globalization of science: “What role is the US playing now, and what role will it play in the future of international science?”; and b) the ability to produce beneficial innovations for society: “How will the US continue to foster its strengths?”

This bibliometric study of a large publication set dealing with research on climate change aims at mapping the relevant literature from a bibliometric perspective and presents a multitude of quantitative data: (1) The growth of the overall publication output as well as (2) of some major subfields, (3) the contributing journals and countries as well as their citation impact, and (4) a title word analysis aiming to illustrate the time evolution and relative importance of specific research topics. The study is based on 222,060 papers (articles and reviews only) published between 1980 and 2014. The total number of papers shows a strong increase with a doubling every 5–6 years. Continental biomass related research is the major subfield, closely followed by climate modeling. Research dealing with adaptation, mitigation, risks, and vulnerability of global warming is comparatively small, but their share of papers increased exponentially since 2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest proportion of very important papers (in terms of citation impact). Climate change research has become an issue also for disciplines beyond the natural sciences. The categories Engineering and Social Sciences show the strongest field-specific relative increase. The Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Climate, the Geophysical Research Letters, and Climatic Change appear at the top positions in terms of the total number of papers published. Research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries (having published more than 10,000 papers). Also, Switzerland, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top—the impact of their contributions is on a high level. The title word analysis shows that the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling.

The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) Consultative Group on Modeling outline a research and development agenda to ensure that appropriate models are in place to guide malaria elimination.

Malaria modeling can inform policy and guide research for malaria elimination and eradication from local implementation to global policy. A research and development agenda for malaria modeling is proposed, to support operations and to enhance the broader eradication research agenda. Models are envisioned as an integral part of research, planning, and evaluation, and modelers should ideally be integrated into multidisciplinary teams to update the models iteratively, communicate their appropriate use, and serve the needs of other research scientists, public health specialists, and government officials. A competitive and collaborative framework will result in policy recommendations from multiple, independently derived models and model systems that share harmonized databases. As planned, modeling results will be produced in five priority areas: (1) strategic planning to determine where and when resources should be optimally allocated to achieve eradication; (2) management plans to minimize the evolution of drug and pesticide resistance; (3) impact assessments of new and needed tools to interrupt transmission; (4) technical feasibility assessments to determine appropriate combinations of tools, an associated set of target intervention coverage levels, and the expected timelines for achieving a set of goals in different socio-ecological settings and different health systems; and (5) operational feasibility assessments to weigh the economic costs, capital investments, and human resource capacities required.

Pedro Alonso and colleagues introduce the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative and the set of articles published in this PLoS Medicine Supplement that distill the research questions key to malaria eradication.

The interruption of malaria transmission worldwide is one of the greatest challenges for international health and development communities. The current expert view suggests that, by aggressively scaling up control with currently available tools and strategies, much greater gains could be achieved against malaria, including elimination from a number of countries and regions; however, even with maximal effort we will fall short of global eradication. The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) complements the current research agenda—primarily directed towards reducing morbidity and mortality—with one that aims to identify key knowledge gaps and define the strategies and tools that will result in reducing the basic reproduction rate to less than 1, with the ultimate aim of eradication of the parasite from the human population. Sustained commitment from local communities, civil society, policy leaders, and the scientific community, together with a massive effort to build a strong base of researchers from the endemic areas will be critical factors in the success of this new agenda.

Methods: Bibliographic searches were conducted to identify publications (1985–2009) concerned with 35 neurodevelopmental disorders: Developmental dyslexia, Developmental dyscalculia, Developmental coordination disorder, Speech sound disorder, Specific language impairment, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Autistic spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, Intellectual disability, Angelman syndrome, Cerebral palsy, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fetal alcohol syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Galactosaemia, Klinefelter syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Phenylketonuria, Prader-Willi syndrome, Rett syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Trisomy 18, Tuberous sclerosis, Turner syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, Williams syndrome, XXX and XYY. A publication index reflecting N publications relative to prevalence was derived. Results: The publication index was higher for rare than common conditions. However, this was partly explained by the tendency for rare disorders to be more severe. Interpretation: Although research activity is predictable from severity and prevalence, there are exceptions. Low rates of research, and relatively low levels of NIH funding, characterise conditions that are the domain of a single discipline with limited research resources. Growth in research is not explained by severity, and was exceptionally steep for autism and ADHD. ",Dorothy V. M.

Reproducibility in animal research is alarmingly low, and a lack of scientific rigor has been proposed as a major cause. Systematic reviews found low reporting rates of measures against risks of bias (e.g., randomization, blinding), and a correlation between low reporting rates and overstated treatment effects. Reporting rates of measures against bias are thus used as a proxy measure for scientific rigor, and reporting guidelines (e.g., ARRIVE) have become a major weapon in the fight against risks of bias in animal research. Surprisingly, animal scientists have never been asked about their use of measures against risks of bias and how they report these in publications. Whether poor reporting reflects poor use of such measures, and whether reporting guidelines may effectively reduce risks of bias has therefore remained elusive. To address these questions, we asked in vivo researchers about their use and reporting of measures against risks of bias and examined how self-reports relate to reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. An online survey was sent out to all registered in vivo researchers in Switzerland (N = 1891) and was complemented by personal interviews with five representative in vivo researchers to facilitate interpretation of the survey results. Return rate was 28% (N = 530), of which 302 participants (16%) returned fully completed questionnaires that were used for further analysis. According to the researchers’ self-report, they use measures against risks of bias to a much greater extent than suggested by reporting rates obtained through systematic reviews. However, the researchers’ self-reports are likely biased to some extent. Thus, although they claimed to be reporting measures against risks of bias at much lower rates than they claimed to be using these measures, the self-reported reporting rates were considerably higher than reporting rates found by systematic reviews. Furthermore, participants performed rather poorly when asked to choose effective over ineffective measures against six different biases. Our results further indicate that knowledge of the ARRIVE guidelines had a positive effect on scientific rigor. However, the ARRIVE guidelines were known by less than half of the participants (43.7%); and among those whose latest paper was published in a journal that had endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines, more than half (51%) had never heard of these guidelines. Our results suggest that whereas reporting rates may underestimate the true use of measures against risks of bias, self-reports may overestimate it. To a large extent, this discrepancy can be explained by the researchers’ ignorance and lack of knowledge of risks of bias and measures to prevent them. Our analysis thus adds significant new evidence to the assessment of research integrity in animal research. Our findings further question the confidence that the authorities have in scientific rigor, which is taken for granted in the harm-benefit analyses on which approval of animal experiments is based. Furthermore, they suggest that better education on scientific integrity and good research practice is needed. However, they also question reliance on reporting rates as indicators of scientific rigor and highlight a need for more reliable predictors.

1810,"Objective: In this study, Argentine health researchers were surveyed regarding their perceptions of facilitators and barriers to evidence-based policymaking in Argentina, as well as their publication activities, and research environment satisfaction. Methods: A self-administered online survey was sent to health researchers in Argentina. The survey questions were based on a preceding qualitative study of Argentine health researchers, as well as the scientific literature. Results: Of the 647 researchers that were reached, 226 accessed the survey, for a response rate of 34.9%. Over 80% of researchers surveyed had never been involved in or contributed to decision-making, while over 90% of researchers indicated they would like to be involved in the decision-making process. Decision-maker self-interest was perceived to be the driving factor in the development of health and healthcare policies. Research conducted by a research leader was seen to be the most influential factor in influencing health policy, followed by policy relevance of the research. With respect to their occupational environment, researchers rated highest and most favourably the opportunities available to present, discuss and publish research results and their ability to further their education and training. Argentine researchers surveyed demonstrated a strong interest and willingness to contribute their work and expertise to inform Argentine health policy development. Conclusion: Despite Argentina’s long scientific tradition, there are relatively few institutionalized linkages between health research results and health policymaking. Based on the results of this study, the disconnect between political decision-making and the health research system, coupled with fewer opportunities for formalized or informal researcher/decision-maker interaction, contribute to the challenges in evidence informing health policymaking in Argentina. Improving personal contact and the building of relationships between researchers and policymakers in Argentina will require taking into account researcher perceptions of policymakers, as highlighted in this study.

Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.

Significant progress has been made in the past few years in the development of recommendations, policies, and procedures for creating and promoting citations to data sets, software, and other research infrastructures like computing facilities. Open questions remain, however, about the extent to which referencing practices of authors of scholarly publications are changing in ways desired by these initiatives. This paper uses four focused case studies to evaluate whether research infrastructures are being increasingly identified and referenced in the research literature via persistent citable identifiers. The findings of the case studies show that references to such resources are increasing, but that the patterns of these increases are variable. In addition, the study suggests that citation practices for data sets may change more slowly than citation practices for software and research facilities, due to the inertia of existing practices for referencing the use of data. Similarly, existing practices for acknowledging computing support may slow the adoption of formal citations for computing resources.

1819,"Background: Many disabling human retinal disorders involve the central retina, particularly the macula. However, the commonly used rodent models in research, mouse and rat, do not possess a macula. The purpose of this study was to identify small laboratory rodents with a significant central region as potential new models for macular research. Methodology/Principal Findings: Gerbillus perpallidus, Meriones unguiculatus and Phodopus campbelli, laboratory rodents less commonly used in retinal research, were subjected to confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO), fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using standard equipment (Heidelberg Engineering HRA1 and Spectralis™) adapted to small rodent eyes. The existence of a visual streak-like pattern was assessed on the basis of vascular topography, retinal thickness, and the topography of retinal ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors. All three species examined showed evidence of a significant horizontal streak-like specialization. cSLO angiography and retinal wholemounts revealed that superficial retinal blood vessels typically ramify and narrow into a sparse capillary net at the border of the respective area located dorsal to the optic nerve. Similar to the macular region, there was an absence of larger blood vessels in the streak region. Furthermore, the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and the population density of neurons in the ganglion cell layer were markedly increased in the visual streak region. Conclusions/Significance: The retinal specializations of Gerbillus perpallidus, Meriones unguiculatus and Phodopus campbelli resemble features of the primate macula.

All three species examined showed evidence of a significant horizontal streak-like specialization. cSLO angiography and retinal wholemounts revealed that superficial retinal blood vessels typically ramify and narrow into a sparse capillary net at the border of the respective area located dorsal to the optic nerve. Similar to the macular region, there was an absence of larger blood vessels in the streak region. Furthermore, the thickness of the photoreceptor layer and the population density of neurons in the ganglion cell layer were markedly increased in the visual streak region. Conclusions/Significance: The retinal specializations of Gerbillus perpallidus, Meriones unguiculatus and Phodopus campbelli resemble features of the primate macula. Hence, the rodents reported here may serve to study aspects of macular development and diseases like age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, and the preclinical assessment of therapeutic strategies.

What motivates the research strategies of nations and institutions? We suggest that research primarily serves two masters–altruism and economic growth. Some nations focus more research in altruistic (or non-economic) fields while others focus more research in fields associated with economic growth. What causes this difference? Are there characteristics that would suggest why a nation is more aligned with altruism or economic growth? To answer this question, we have identified nine major fields of research by analyzing the publication activity of 4429 institutions using Scopus data. Two fields of research are clearly altruistic (there is relatively little involvement by industry) and two fields are clearly aligned with economic growth. The altruistic vs. economic nature of nations based on their publication profiles across these fields is correlated with national indicators on wealth, education, capitalism, individualism, power, religion, and language. While previous research has suggested that national research strategy is aligned with national wealth, our analysis shows that national wealth is not highly correlated with the tradeoff between altruistic and economic motives. Instead, the tradeoff is largely captured by a culture of individualism. Accordingly, implications for national research strategies are discussed.

Optimal nutrition is critical for human development and economic growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is facing high levels of food insecurity and only few sub-Saharan African countries are on track to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. Effective research capacity is crucial for addressing emerging challenges and designing appropriate mitigation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. A clear understanding of the operating environment for nutrition research in sub-Saharan Africa is a much needed prerequisite. We collected data on the barriers and requirements for conducting nutrition research in sub-Saharan Africa through semi-structured interviews with 144 participants involved in nutrition research in 35 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 133 interviews were retained for coding. The main barriers identified for effective nutrition research were the lack of funding due to poor recognition by policymakers of the importance of nutrition research and under-utilisation of research findings for developing policy, as well as an absence of research priority setting from within Africa. Current research topics were perceived to be mainly determined by funding bodies from outside Africa. Nutrition researchers argued for more commitment from policymakers at national level. The low capacity for nutrition research was mainly seen as a consequence of insufficient numbers of nutrition researchers, limited skills and a poor research infrastructure. In conclusion, African nutrition researchers argued how research priorities need to be identified by African stakeholders, accompanied by consensus building to enable creating a problem-driven national research agenda. In addition, it was considered necessary to promote interactions among researchers, and between researchers and policymakers. Multidisciplinary research and international and cross-African collaboration were seen as crucial to build capacity in sub-Saharan nutrition research.

Sharing research data by depositing it in connection with a published article or otherwise making data publicly available sometimes raises intellectual property questions in the minds of depositing researchers, their employers, their funders, and other researchers who seek to reuse research data. In this context or in the drafting of data management plans, common questions are (1) what are the legal rights in data; (2) who has these rights; and (3) how does one with these rights use them to share data in a way that permits or encourages productive downstream uses? Leaving to the side privacy and national security laws that regulate sharing certain types of data, this Perspective explains how to work through the general intellectual property and contractual issues for all research data.

This Perspective addresses questions and concerns that biologists often have about intellectual property rights in research data and how these interact with the deposition or sharing of data.

Understanding emerging areas of a multidisciplinary research field is crucial for researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders. For them a knowledge structure based on longitudinal bibliographic data can be an effective instrument. But with the vast amount of available online information it is often hard to understand the knowledge structure for data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for retrieving online bibliographic data and propose a framework for exploring knowledge structure.

Understanding emerging areas of a multidisciplinary research field is crucial for researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders. For them a knowledge structure based on longitudinal bibliographic data can be an effective instrument. But with the vast amount of available online information it is often hard to understand the knowledge structure for data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for retrieving online bibliographic data and propose a framework for exploring knowledge structure. We also present several longitudinal analyses to interpret and visualize the last 20 years of published obesity research data.

Biomedical research is increasingly collaborative, and successful collaborations often produce high impact work. Computational approaches can be developed for automatically predicting biomedical research collaborations. Previous works of collaboration prediction mainly explored the topological structures of research collaboration networks, leaving out rich semantic information from the publications themselves. In this paper, we propose supervised machine learning approaches to predict research collaborations in the biomedical field. We explored both the semantic features extracted from author research interest profile and the author network topological features. We found that the most informative semantic features for author collaborations are related to research interest, including similarity of out-citing citations, similarity of abstracts. Of the four supervised machine learning models (naïve Bayes, naïve Bayes multinomial, SVMs, and logistic regression), the best performing model is logistic regression with an ROC ranging from 0.766 to 0.980 on different datasets. To our knowledge we are the first to study in depth how research interest and productivities can be used for collaboration prediction. Our approach is computationally efficient, scalable and yet simple to implement. The datasets of this study are available at https://github.com/qingzhanggithub/medline-collaboration-datasets.

There has been a substantial increase in research activity on autism during the past decade. Research into effective ways of responding to the immediate needs of autistic people is, however, less advanced, as are efforts at translating basic science research into service provision. Involving community members in research is one potential way of reducing this gap. This study therefore investigated the views of community involvement in autism research both from the perspectives of autism researchers and of community members, including autistic adults, family members and practitioners. Results from a large-scale questionnaire study (n = 1,516) showed that researchers perceive themselves to be engaged with the autism community but that community members, most notably autistic people and their families, did not share this view. Focus groups/interviews with 72 participants further identified the potential benefits and remaining challenges to involvement in research, especially regarding the distinct perspectives of different stakeholders. Researchers were skeptical about the possibilities of dramatically increasing community engagement, while community members themselves spoke about the challenges to fully understanding and influencing the research process. We suggest that the lack of a shared approach to community engagement in UK autism research represents a key roadblock to translational endeavors.

Post-tensioned concrete design can lead to considerable savings in materials  construction time and future maintenance costs  compared to the conventional reinforced concrete design. Pre-stressing improves the behaviour of concrete in tension. Thus  for the same imposed load  a more slender structure can be designed. Reduced slab depth results in reduced building height and savings in related building components. These savings translate into less material usage which means reduced embodied energy for a structure thus  creating a sustainable solution. In this study  buildings with post-tensioned and conventional reinforced concrete slab systems are compared. Two buildings with the same floor plans are designed using reinforced concrete and post-tensioned slab systems. The span length is chosen as 6.5 m  which is a practical limit for a relatively economical reinforced concrete solution. The buildings are designed as 10  20 and 40 stories to demonstrate the change in material savings as the number of floors increases. Since post-tensioned slabs can be designed thinner for the same loads and spans  total weight of the structure reduces and this results in smaller columns  lower seismic loads and foundation loads. The results showed that the difference in steel material savings between conventional and post-tensioned solutions increases as the number of floors increases.

Wet processing is a main sector in textile industries  which affects the end product and their quality of textiles. Large amount of water  chemicals and energy are required for various stages of wet processing operation. In this wet processing  Water is used as the solvent for the chemicals and dyes  because of its low price and availability. But  during the process  water gets polluted with chemicals and unspent dye stuffs and gives an end product as effluent. The toxic effluent is not easy to treat or biodegrade and is harmful to humans and animals. This kind of contamination and health problems arises normally in the conventional method of wet processing. So  the alternative methods are necessary to improve the sustainability of the textile wet processing. In the recent time  the new eco-friendly methods have been developed and are preferred mostly instead of conventional methods. Plasma  ultrasonic  laser  biotechnology digital inkjet printing are the new innovated eco-friendly technologies  which provide more advantages to wet processing. In these methods  there are no any harmful chemical  wastewater and mechanical hazards to textiles  etc. This study also clearly discusses the various stages of wet processing operations such as desizing  scouring  bleaching  mercerizing  dyeing  finishing and printing with a new innovated trend and their eco-friendly procedures and technologies on the wet processing.,Senthil Kumar  P.,2018,Detox Fashion,P.2018,,,Springer,,Sustainable Wet Processing—An Alternative Source for Detoxifying Supply Chain in Textiles,d45c6b19d0b29c8c35a5dea0e6499e98

1865,In this chapter  our research has been focused on a campaign to overcome the people from the slavement of hazardous chemicals for benefits of short intervals. Different Brands have been recognized with their opinions on the look of their detox 2020 deadline to amputate deadly chemicals not only from their products but from the entire supply chain  if they have the necessary tools to be fit for 2020. For decades  industrial companies have become the major culprit to use the environment and in particular our waterways as a deposition ground for hazardous chemicals and unaffected policies by inefficient government provisions. Water pollution has become a nightmare for local communities that living near manufacturing facilities. There is no ‘safe’ level left particularly in the Global South  because for persistent  hazardous chemicals and loose provisions have not always clogged the emission of poison chemicals into the atmosphere. In future  government will be pushing for exuberant exemplary alteration on dynamic towards “terminating and unfastening the loop”. During the campaign  it appeared that there are two problems which are encountered on the progression of sustainability. First of all  it illustrated out that many fashion companies still have little transparency on their accountability of supply chain  especially the transparency down to farmer level is lacking. Hence  it is very difficult to source materials without transparency in a responsible way. In addition to the speed of the fashion seasons is already causing high pressure for designers working in fashion companies as some companies produce  dump and throw up to 12 collection in a year. People in the industry do not expect this to change because it responds to the demands of the consumer. As an outcomes of the research recommendations on sustainable design strategies are put together in a final product  targeted at textile companies  fashion companies and fashion designers. The final product exists after following the mandatory guidelines from a manual for sustainable fashion design  and this handbook could serve as a helpful tool for the implementation of (one of the) strategies.,Grover  Tarun,2018,Detox Fashion,Tarun2018,,,Springer,,Integrating Sustainable Strategies in Fashion Design by Detox 2020 Plan—Case Studies from Different Brands,4902cf2cf456ed494b07f479abb28878
1866,In most nations  textile waste management is recognized to be a multi-actor system; however most participating actors tend to play a significant role in handling and treating the textile waste single-handedly thus resulting in a very fragmented system fraught with many challenges. In addition  the main textile waste treatment  e.g. in Sweden is still incineration (nearly 55% of per capita disposal) resulting in low degrees of value generation. Nearly 20% of the waste is handled by ten major charities in Sweden. This highlights the necessity for the actors to perform in a network and expand their collaboration  thus move more efficiently towards development of a sustainable value innovation  and find an alternative new way to manage textile waste.

Overall our study provides a rich and descriptive picture of the participating actors  their activities  collaboration and value-orientations within the Swedish textile waste management system  and highlights the key drivers of a collaborative solution  viz. legislation  trust and shared understanding and communication  that can be foreseen to increase dialogue and collaboration among actors to support the movement from egocentric to a multi-actor business model. A clear benefit of such collaborative business models is substitution of incineration by higher degrees of reuse of textiles  which has high potential to generate positive environmental impact  through reduction of toxic effects of textile incineration and also new production processes.,Pal  Rudrajeet,2018,Detox Fashion,Armaghan2018,,,Springer,,New Textile Waste Management Through Collaborative Business Models for Sustainable Innovation,010abecbe6dd43a40d467a93a9ddaee6
1869,Artificial recharge is used to increase the availability of groundwater storage and reduce saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers  where pumping and droughts have severely impaired groundwater quality. The implementation of optimal recharge methods requires knowledge of physical  chemical  and biological phenomena involving water and wastewater filtration in the subsoil  together with engineering aspects related to plant design and maintenance operations. This study uses a novel Decision Support System (DSS)  which includes soil aquifer treatment (SAT) evaluation  to design an artificial recharge plant. The DSS helps users make strategic decisions on selecting the most appropriate recharge methods and water treatment technologies at specific sites. This will enable the recovery of safe water using managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practices  and result in reduced recharge costs. The DSS was built using an artificial intelligence technique and knowledge-based technology  related to both quantitative and qualitative aspects of water supply for artificial recharge. The DSS software was implemented using rules based on the cumulative experience of wastewater treatment plant engineers and groundwater modeling. Appropriate model flow simulations were performed in porous and fractured coastal aquifers to evaluate the suitability of this technique for enhancing the integrated water resources management approach. Results obtained from the AQUASTRESS integrated project and DRINKADRIA IPA CBC suggest the most effective strategies for wastewater treatments prior to recharge at specific sites.,Masciopinto  Costantino,2017,Water Resources Management,Costantino2017,,,Springer,,A Suitable Tool for Sustainable Groundwater Management,148dedc6455e15aabff8ab8cef97cbb3

1873,Moving away from crude oil to renewable resources for the production of a wide range of compounds is a challenge for future generations. To overcome this  the use of lignocellulose as substrate can contribute to drastically reduce the consumption of crude oil. In this study  sugars from lignocellulose were used as a starting material for the enzymatic synthesis of surface-active sugar esters. The substrates were obtained by an acid-catalyzed  beechwood pretreatment process  which resulted in a fiber fraction that is subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain the monosaccharides. After purification and drying  this glucose- and xylose-rich fraction was used to create a deep eutectic solvent  which acts both as solvent and substrate for the lipase-catalyzed reaction at the same time. Finally  the successful synthesis of glycolipids from a sustainable resource was confirmed by ESI–Q–ToF mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR experiments.

1883,Nature of Landuse/Land cover (LULC) changes has been assessed for many ecosystems  but there is limited knowledge on how different stakeholders perceive such changes. Information on this is required before sound interventions to address adverse impacts of the changes can be introduced. This paper utilised secondary and questionnaire survey data  complimented with focus group discussion  to assess how different stakeholders (famers  forestry workers  construction workers  artisans  resource managers  civil servants and private sector workers) perceive LULC changes induced by urban growth in rural (Karshi and Orozo) and urban (Karu and Nyanya) areas of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) of Federal Capital Territory  Nigeria. LULC change data revealed declines in cultivated areas  grasslands and bare lands  and corresponding expansion of built-up and vegetated areas over 1987–2014. Different stakeholders in both rural and urban locations of the area are generally aware of the nature of the changes. Those in rural locations have some very close interactions with features such as soil  water  and vegetation and are aware of the kinds of their changes. The urban dwellers are largely aware of changes in human aspects of the LULC. The respondents generally indicated that vegetation cover has been declining due to urban growth in the study area but secondary data analysis revealed opposite trend. Appropriate recommendations were given to improve soil  water and vegetation management in the study area.,Mashi  Sani Abubakar,2017,GeoJournal,Abubakar2017,,,Springer,,People and sustainable land management: assessment of stakeholders knowledge of the nature of landuse/cover change in Abuja  Nigeria,b6b739e3dfe5df9a4696546fe45e3cac

1887,Agriculture remains the backbone of most African economies  yet land degradation severely hampers agricultural productivity. Over the last decades  scientists and development practitioners have advocated integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices to improve soil fertility. However  their adoption rates are low  partly because many farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are not fully aware of the principles of this system innovation. This has been attributed to a wide communication gap between farmers and other agricultural actors in agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS). We add to the literature by applying innovation system approaches to ISFM awareness processes. This study aims to assess if AKIS are effectively disseminating ISFM knowledge by comparing results from two sites in Kenya and Ghana  which differ in the uptake of ISFM. Social network measures and statistical methods were employed using data from key formal actors and farmers. Our results suggest that the presence of weak knowledge ties is important for the awareness of ISFM at both research sites. However  in Kenya AKIS are more effective as there is a network of knowledge ties crucial for not only dissemination but also learning of complex innovations. This is largely lacking in Ghana where integration of formal and informal agricultural knowledge systems may be enhanced by fostering the function of informal and formal innovation brokers.,Adolwa  Ivan S.,2017,Agriculture and Human Values,S.2017,,,Springer,,A comparative analysis of agricultural knowledge and innovation systems in Kenya and Ghana: sustainable agricultural intensification in the rural–urban interface,3b63bc09976a00bd2c11fe5e34369adb

1896,Facility layout design  a NP hard problem  is associated with the arrangement of facilities in a manufacturing shop floor  which impacts the performance  and cost of system. Efficient design of facility layout is a key to the sustainable operations in a manufacturing shop floor. An efficient layout design not only optimizes the cost and energy due to proficient handling but also increase flexibility and easy accessibility.

1901,Data centers are major contributors to the emission of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere  and this contribution is expected to increase in the following years. This has encouraged the development of techniques to reduce the energy consumption and the environmental footprint of data centers. Whereas some of these techniques have succeeded to reduce the energy consumption of the hardware equipment of data centers (including IT  cooling  and power supply systems)  we claim that sustainable data centers will be only possible if the problem is faced by means of a holistic approach that includes not only the aforementioned techniques but also intelligent and unifying solutions that enable a synergistic and energy-aware management of data centers. In this paper  we propose a comprehensive strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of data centers that uses the energy as a driver of their management procedures. In addition  we present a holistic management architecture for sustainable data centers that implements the aforementioned strategy  and we propose design guidelines to accomplish each step of the proposed strategy  referring to related achievements and enumerating the main challenges that must be still solved.,Guitart  Jordi,2017,Computing,Jordi2017,,,Springer,,Toward sustainable data centers: a comprehensive energy management strategy,b1b2d1f4adb7b2a7c16aeff74476e014
1902,Economic growth has been strongly associated with urbanization  overwhelming cities with vehicles. This renders mobility inside cities problematic  since it is often associated with large waste of time in traffic congestions  environmental pollution and accidents. Cities struggle to invent and deploy continuously evolving  “smart” solutions in the domain of urban mobility  so as to improve the overall quality of life therein. In this context  the paper discusses on the fundamental challenges that cities face when trying to become smarter  focusing on the particular area of mobility-as-a-service. Moreover  the paper describes a specific framework that leverages on 5G mobile communication infrastructures  in order to increase the effectiveness of vehicular communications and the relevant mobility services and applications offered in urban environments.,Dimitrakopoulos  George,2017,Evolving Systems,George2017,,,Springer,,Sustainable mobility leveraging on 5G mobile communication infrastructures in the context of smart city operations,11b8c5be0f54ca131dbd70e0e12f2ee3

1912,Treated wastewater (TWW) is an imperative nonconventional water resource for reuse in irrigation to cope with the water shortage and agricultural expansion in Egypt. The Bahr El-Baqar drain in Sharqia  Egypt  is one of the main drains in the Nile Delta that receives various types of wastewater. Monitoring and assessing the drain’s water quality were achieved by collecting georeferenced water samples along the drain during the 2015 summer and winter cropping seasons. Chemical  microbial  and parasitic analyses were performed. Additionally  surface soil samples irrigated with the drain water were gathered from the adjacent area to quantify the main physicochemical properties. Water analysis results revealed that the concentrations of most trace elements were within international standards and the Egyptian allowable levels for TWW reuse in agriculture. Oxygen depletion was observed for all samples collected. The microbial analysis indicated that there was fecal coliform contamination (>1000 per 100 mL) in the summer and winter samples.

1921,The proper disposal of discarded waste tires is becoming a serious matter of concern worldwide as huge proportion of this waste is being generated which makes the proper disposal virtually infeasible. About 1000 million of waste tires are discarded every year  and by the year 2030  it will turn up to 1200 million per year. If this enormous quantum of waste remains unattended  it would led to serious health and environmental problems. The investigation aims at appraising the compaction and strength characteristics of clayey soil incorporated with waste crumb rubber and cement for its sustainable use in geotechnical application. A series of unconfined compression strength and split tensile strength tests were carried out on clayey soil incorporated with two percentages of cement (3 and 6%) by weight and four percentages of crumb rubber (2.5  5.0  7.5  and 10.0%) by weight. Moreover  scanning electron microscope analysis was also carried out to get better intuition about the behaviour of the composite. Test results suggested that crumb rubber (up to 5%) could be mixed with uncemented/cemented clay soil with the congruent impression. The inclusion of discarded waste tires in cemented clay would be one of the congenial methods for the disposal of this waste as it substantially reduces the deleterious influence of waste tire disposal on human health and ecology.,Yadav  J.

1926,Resource development projects typically result in monitoring programs that fail to fully consider the values and participation of surrounding communities. Also  monitoring protocols for single environmental values can be insufficient for addressing the cumulative impacts of resource development. Community-based environmental monitoring (CBEM) has emerged as a way to meaningfully include local citizens in the decision-making process and assessment of the development of natural resources. Our research explored how to develop effective and sustainable CBEM. Interviews were conducted with staff from 15 CBEM programs established across Canada to identify criteria of what constitutes effective CBEM. Results demonstrate that CBEM offers an effective  locally adapted  and culturally applicable approach to facilitate community participation in natural resource management and to track environmental change. Benefits of CBEM include: locally relevant monitoring protocols  inclusion of cumulative impacts  better informed decision-making  and increased awareness and collaboration amongst community  governments  and proponents. Challenges associated with CBEM are cost  capacity  longevity  distribution of results  and establishing credibility.

Also  monitoring protocols for single environmental values can be insufficient for addressing the cumulative impacts of resource development. Community-based environmental monitoring (CBEM) has emerged as a way to meaningfully include local citizens in the decision-making process and assessment of the development of natural resources. Our research explored how to develop effective and sustainable CBEM. Interviews were conducted with staff from 15 CBEM programs established across Canada to identify criteria of what constitutes effective CBEM. Results demonstrate that CBEM offers an effective  locally adapted  and culturally applicable approach to facilitate community participation in natural resource management and to track environmental change. Benefits of CBEM include: locally relevant monitoring protocols  inclusion of cumulative impacts  better informed decision-making  and increased awareness and collaboration amongst community  governments  and proponents. Challenges associated with CBEM are cost  capacity  longevity  distribution of results  and establishing credibility. This research validates the use of CBEM for improving resource management.,Johnson  Chris J.,2017,Environmental Management,J.2017,,,Springer,,Identifying Effective and Sustainable Measures for Community-Based Environmental Monitoring,12c4229686829360fb56d8fa8ae82f87
1928,Decisions on sustainable development issues usually involve multiple stakeholders with multiple and often conflicting perspectives. Participatory processes along with sound multicriteria analysis tools and models for cooperative group decision-making can support stakeholders to select the best actions. This article presents a real-world application of the MACBETH socio-technical approach for the sustainable redevelopment of a brownfield. The project is aimed at presenting a visible and high-profile participation process that could trigger a domino effect for other mine brownfield redevelopment projects to follow in Portugal. A group of key stakeholders was chosen to represent the main evaluation perspectives of the decision context. Structuring the problem was carried out during a decision conference. As it was not possible to apply a full decision conferencing procedure  we conducted at distance a novel participatory process supported by several decision support tools (M-MACBETH  MACBETH Voting  and Web-MACBETH) to evaluate and select the actions under a weak sustainability assumption. Two alternative multicriteria aggregation schemes were applied in order to assist the group in evaluating the added value and doability of the proposed actions. New measures and methods to analyze the dominance relationships between the actions were proposed  further assisting the group in the priority selection of the most effective and doable sustainable actions. Ex-post evaluations of the proposed approach identified its associated benefits and shortcomings. By-products of the research include case study evidences suggesting that decision conferencing yields more aligned evaluations than a nominal group process  and that each brownfield redevelopment action is typically assessed as having consequences across multiple sustainability criteria.,Mateus  Ricardo J.

1936,Sustainability science is a solution-oriented discipline. Yet  there are few theory-rich discussions about how this orientation structures the efforts of sustainability science. We argue that Niklas Luhmann’s social system theory  which explains how societies communicate problems  conceptualize solutions  and identify pathways towards implementation of solutions  is valuable in explaining the general structure of sustainability science. From Luhmann  we focus on two key concepts. First  his notion of resonance offers us a way to account for how sustainability science has attended and responded to environmental risks. As a product of resonance  we reveal solution-oriented research as the strategic coordination of capacities  resources  and information. Second  Luhmann’s interests in self-organizing processes explain how sustainability science can simultaneously advance multiple innovations. The value logic that supports this multiplicity of self-organizing activities as a recognition that human and natural systems are complex coupled and mutually influencing. To give form to this theoretical framework  we offer case evidence of renewable energy policy formation in Texas. Although the state’s wealth is rooted in a fossil-fuel heritage  Texas generates more electricity from wind than any US state. It is politically antagonistic towards climate-change policy  yet the state’s reception of wind energy technology illustrates how social and environmental systems can be strategically aligned to generate solutions that address diverse needs simultaneously. This case demonstrates that isolating climate change—as politicians do as a separate and discrete problem—is incapable of achieving sustainable solutions  and resonance offers researchers a framework for conceptualizing  designing  and communicating meaningfully integrated actions.,Hall  Damon M.,2017,Sustainability Science,M.2017,,,Springer,,Social-ecological system resonance: a theoretical framework for brokering sustainable solutions,6301778c6b4a6126eb23b1cc633e1c00

1941,Transportation sector  including maritime transport  exerts significant environmental impact. Public procurement as a policy strategy instrument which applies to the purchase of transport means  construction of infrastructure and the provision logistic services in supplying the goods  services and executing of works must integrate environmental considerations in the contract award procedures. While conventional life-cycle costing (LCC) is based on four categories to be assessed e.g. investment  operation  maintenance and end-of-life disposal expenses  the environmental LCC method also takes into account the external environmental costs. The paper is focused on sustainable public procurement and environmental life-cycle costing aspects of EU 2014 Directive. Analysis is made of the real cost of procurement  the externalities and the impact of maritime transport sector on the environment. The purpose of this research is to propose the framework for assessment of integral impact on the environment which combines environmental LCC approach with TBL concept using non-monetary units for measuring externalities. The authors advocate clean and energy-efficient maritime transport ensuring effective implementation of environmental policy objectives and targets and emphasize the role of public authorities and entities in fostering the inclusion of environmental externalities in calculation of LCC.,Luttenberger  Axel,2017,WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs,Axel2017,,,Springer,,Sustainable procurement and environmental life-cycle costing in maritime transport,44da21871ccf5fd89d9d42f693532acd

With the rapid development of cloud computing  more and more consumers adopt third-party cloud services to implement their critical business. Cloud services are provided by different service providers  and usually have different cost performance and quality of service. Service consumers have to make trade-offs on multiple factors in order to choose the appropriate cloud services. Therefore  an efficient cloud service selection mechanism makes sense for both cloud service providers and consumers. According to existing works  this research field still requires appropriate models  effective design paradigm  in-depth experimentations and practical implementations. Because agent can identify the paradigm of the clouds by learning algorithm  they can be trained to observe the differences and behave flexibly for cloud service selection. To rank different clouds  we propose and assign QoS factor for each cloud service and ranks it as whole. According to simulation experiment  we validate the approach  which emphasizes the need to rank cloud services of widely spreading and complex domains.

1957,The teaching action takes an important role to define the educational technology  and various functions/methods to support the teaching actions have been investigated since the research field of educational technology was proposed at first. However  now that we can count 40 or more years since the start-up of the activities in the educational technology  our learning environments were changed. The teaching support technology has enforced the learning process to change drastically from the teaching action  by which a teacher or a tutor instructs at once many learners synchronously in the centralized classroom  to the learning action  which learners themselves must perform their own learning works. In this paper  we address this technological transition from the teaching action to the learning action. Our viewpoint for the technological transition is to discuss the learning process with respect to knowledge management. Also  our concluding remark focuses on the support functionality and the framework for making the learning action clear.,Watanabe  Toyohide,2018,Intelligent Interactive Multimedia Systems and Services 2017,Toyohide2018,,,Springer,,Research View Shift for Supporting Learning Action from Teaching Action,e572b4fb13107a38f4a3de3dec2da3a1

1960,"In the field of rumor spreading  kill rumor is a very important concept. In the previous study of rumor spreading  only considering the rumor from the outside of the network  while ignoring the node itself has the discriminability. In this paper  a new CSER rumor propagation model is proposed and a kind of node with the ability of killing rumor is introduced in the model  that node is called rumor-killer. By means of complex network theory and mean-field method  we establish the differential equations of propagation dynamics. In this paper  the model is used to study the process of rumor spreading both in homogeneous network and heterogeneous network. Through theoretical analysis and experimental simulation  it is found that the node with the ability of killing rumor can mitigate the spreading rumor in the network. This conclusion provides us a new way to control the rumor spreading from the inside of network.

1965,The conceptions of what constitutes nursing competence and how such competence is taught and learned are changing  due to rapid changes in in the health sector. Nurse teachers’ competencies for providing high-quality  up-to-date nursing education  are developing accordingly. This paper reviews the existing research on nurse teachers’ competencies and addresses how this research identifies  describes  and conceptualizes these competencies. A rigorous search  retrieval and appraisal process identified 25 relevant studies for inclusion in the review. A thematic synthesis was applied to the findings of the studies and subsequent themes were synthesized. The thematic synthesis of the empirical evidence resulted in the five broad themes: academic  nursing  and pedagogical competencies; attitudes; management and digital technology. However  these separate elements appeared to be highly integrated. Hence  this paper indicates that nurse teachers’ competencies may be assessed using a holistic approach  which could bring together the disparate attributes required for successful professional performance in specific situations.,Zlatanovic  Tatjana,2017,Vocations and Learning,Tatjana2017,,,Springer,,A Research Review of Nurse Teachers’ Competencies,d4ea4cac50c1862acabd975b259bc183

1969,Existing work on Automated Negotiations commonly assumes the negotiators’ utility functions have explicit closed-form expressions  and can be calculated quickly. In many real-world applications however  the calculation of utility can be a complex  time-consuming problem and utility functions cannot always be expressed in terms of simple formulas. The game of Diplomacy forms an ideal test bed for research on Automated Negotiations in such domains where utility is hard to calculate. Unfortunately  developing a full Diplomacy player is a hard task  which requires more than just the implementation of a negotiation algorithm. The performance of such a player may highly depend on the underlying strategy rather than just its negotiation skills. Therefore  we introduce a new Diplomacy playing agent  called D-Brane  which has won the first international Computer Diplomacy Challenge. It is built up in a modular fashion  disconnecting its negotiation algorithm from its game-playing strategy  to allow future researchers to build their own negotiation algorithms on top of its strategic module. This will allow them to easily compare the performance of different negotiation algorithms. We show that D-Brane strongly outplays a number of previously developed Diplomacy players  even when it does not apply negotiations. Furthermore  we explain the negotiation algorithm applied by D-Brane  and present a number of additional tools  bundled together in the new BANDANA framework  that will make development of Diplomacy-playing agents easier.,Jonge  Dave,2017,Applied Intelligence,Dave2017,,,Springer,,D-Brane: a diplomacy playing agent for automated negotiations research,9979c1ac21659e7df21e25508ebe7eb0

1971,At present  image change detection technology as an important image processing technology has been widely used  and a novel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection algorithm based on hybrid genetic FCM and image registration is proposed in this paper. First of all  the algorithm performs registration with two photographs taken in the same region images at different time using Harris operator and Sift operator  then  the ratio method and logarithmic method is combined to extract the initial differences image  and then the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to reduce the dimension of the difference image. Finally the hybrid genetic fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is used to determine the classification of feature vector space  and the classification results are compared with the reference image  to obtain the change information. The purpose of using hybrid genetic FCM is to divide the initial difference image clustering into the changed type and the unchanged type  so as to get the final segmentation result. The FCM algorithm improved by genetic algorithm can effectively avoid that the FCM algorithm will fall into local minimum when the initial cluster center selection is not appropriate. As the genetic algorithm is a global optimization search algorithm  it can improve the segmentation effect of FCM. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has the highest global correct rate of 98.10% and 99.74%.,Yufeng  Li,2017,Multimedia Tools and Applications,Li2017,,,Springer,,Research on SAR image change detection algorithm based on hybrid genetic FCM and image registration,354a09c125510c95811a03cfc6365fa0

1973,This paper presents the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) enabling two European GEO Geohazard Supersites in Italy. According to GEO (Group on Earth Observation) vision  Geohazard Supersites provide access to spaceborne and in-situ geophysical data and models for selected sites prone to natural hazards –noticeably  earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The VRE was implemented in the framework of the Mediterranean Supersite Volcanoes (MED-SUV) project  funded by the European Commission. MED-SUV realized one of the European supersite demonstrators covering the two Permanent Supersites selected in Italy: Mt. Etna and Campi Flegrei/Vesuvius. The MED-SUV VRE provides advanced services for heterogeneous data and information management and sharing. MED-SUV started identifying the main supersite requirements including: the interoperability with existing data/information supply systems  the support of policy-based access control  the access to processing capabilities provided by external platforms  the management resources for publishing and sharing new products  the integration with significant global systems such as GEOSS and EPOS. MED-SUV adopted a System of Systems (SoS) approach to address interoperability with the identified heterogeneous systems supplying data and information. The SoS approach is based on a brokering architecture  where a specialized component (i.e the MED-SUV Broker: MSB) connects the existing and next-coming data sources leaving them autonomous. MSB carries out all the necessary mediation and harmonization tasks exposing standard interfaces enabling the interconnection with external systems like GEOSS and EPOS. In addition  MSB is accessible via a JavaScript library implementing Web APIs to facilitate the development of Web and mobile applications.,Mazzetti  Paolo,2017,Earth Science Informatics,Paolo2017,,,Springer,,The MED-SUV virtual research environment for enabling the GEO Geohazard supersites in Italy,6e90c9846bfe3bf668127be44c4ef973

1979,This paper presents the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) enabling two European GEO Geohazard Supersites in Italy. According to GEO (Group on Earth Observation) vision  Geohazard Supersites provide access to spaceborne and in-situ geophysical data and models for selected sites prone to natural hazards –noticeably  earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The VRE was implemented in the framework of the Mediterranean Supersite Volcanoes (MED-SUV) project  funded by the European Commission. MED-SUV realized one of the European supersite demonstrators covering the two Permanent Supersites selected in Italy: Mt. Etna and Campi Flegrei/Vesuvius. The MED-SUV VRE provides advanced services for heterogeneous data and information management and sharing. MED-SUV started identifying the main supersite requirements including: the interoperability with existing data/information supply systems  the support of policy-based access control  the access to processing capabilities provided by external platforms  the management resources for publishing and sharing new products  the integration with significant global systems such as GEOSS and EPOS. MED-SUV adopted a System of Systems (SoS) approach to address interoperability with the identified heterogeneous systems supplying data and information. The SoS approach is based on a brokering architecture  where a specialized component (i.e the MED-SUV Broker: MSB) connects the existing and next-coming data sources leaving them autonomous. MSB carries out all the necessary mediation and harmonization tasks exposing standard interfaces enabling the interconnection with external systems like GEOSS and EPOS.

1980,In the field of self-driving technology  the stability and comfort of the intelligent vehicle are the focus of attention. The paper applies cognitive psychology theory to the research of driving behavior and analyzes the behavior mechanism about the driver’s operation. Through applying the theory of hierarchical analysis  we take the safety and comfort of intelligent vehicle as the breakthrough point. And then we took the data of human drivers’ perception behavior as the training set and did regression analysis using the method of regression analysis of machine learning according to the charts of the vehicle speed and the visual field  the vehicle speed and the gaze point as well as the vehicle speed and the dynamic vision. At last we established linear and nonlinear regression models (including the logarithmic model) for the training set. The change in thinking is the first novelty of this paper. Last but not least important  we verified the accuracy of the model through the comparison of different regression analysis. Eventually  it turned out that using logarithmic relationship to express the relationship between the vehicle speed and the visual field  the vehicle speed and the gaze point as well as the vehicle speed and the dynamic vision is better than other models. In the aspect of application  we adopted the technology of multi-sensor fusion and transformed the acquired data from radar  navigation and image to log-polar coordinates  which makes us greatly simplify information when dealing with massive data problems from different sensors. This approach can not only reduce the complexity of the server’s processing but also drives the development of intelligent vehicle in information computing. We also make this model applied in the intelligent driver’s cognitive interactive debugging program  which can better explain and understand the intelligent driving behavior and improved the safety of intelligent vehicle to some extent.,Guan  Quanzhen,2017,Cluster Computing,Quanzhen2017,,,Springer,,The research of prediction model on intelligent vehicle based on driver’s perception,6f119eed5be86f537cc345d9999b20fb

1983,We explore the innovation performance benefits of alliances for spin-off firms  in particular spin-offs either from other firms or from public research organizations. During the early years of the emerging combinatorial chemistry industry  the industry on which our empirical analysis focuses  spin-offs engaged in alliances with large and established partners  partners of similar type and size  and with public research organizations  often for different reasons. We seek to understand to what extent alliances of spin-offs with other firms (either large- or small- and medium-sized firms) affected their innovation performance and also how this performance may have been affected by their corporate or public research background. We find evidence that in general alliances of spin-offs with other firms  in particular alliances with large firms  increased their innovation performance. Corporate spin-offs that formed alliances with other firms outperformed public research spin-offs with such alliances. This suggests that  in terms of their innovation performance  corporate spin-offs that engaged in alliances with other firms seemed to have benefitted from their prior corporate background.

1996,The aim of this study was to examine the time to cessation of ADHD medication amongst young people with ADHD aged 16 in the period 2005–2013. Previous studies of prescribing in primary care reported high rates of medication cessation amongst 16 and 17 year olds with ADHD. The examination of trends since the introduction of new NICE guidance in 2008 will support service planning and improvement of outcomes over the vulnerable transition period from child to adult services. We used primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and identified cases prescribed ADHD medication at the time of their 16th birthday during the study period. The outcome was time to medication cessation from the age of 16. Cessation of medication was defined as occurring at the beginning of a gap of over 6 months in prescriptions. 1620 cases were included. The median time to cessation was 1.51 years (95% CI 1.42–1.67).The estimated probability of remaining on medication was 0.63 (95% CI 0.61–0.65) at age 17 (i.e.  at 1 year) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.39–0.43) at age 18.

1997,The aim of this study was to examine the time to cessation of ADHD medication amongst young people with ADHD aged 16 in the period 2005–2013. Previous studies of prescribing in primary care reported high rates of medication cessation amongst 16 and 17 year olds with ADHD. The examination of trends since the introduction of new NICE guidance in 2008 will support service planning and improvement of outcomes over the vulnerable transition period from child to adult services.

2001,Human resources are increasingly crucial to the growing economies of East Asia  which are striving to diversify economically toward higher value-added product-markets to continue their growth. Human resource management (HRM) in Taiwan  based on Confucianism and influenced by Western management research and practice  has been experiencing a major paradigm shift of sorts in recent years. With Taiwan’s rapid economic growth followed by its industrial and institutional transformation  HRM in the region has been developing to cope with the increasingly competitive and fast-changing business world. As such  this study reviews HRM’s development in Taiwan over the recent decades. The reviewed studies were gathered from work published from 1990 to 2016 appearing in the Social Sciences Citation Index or Taiwan Social Sciences Citation Index Chinese journals.

2004,This Perspectives paper draws attention to what I would call “industry-focused research” as an approach in management research that I believe can potentially contribute to the improvement of non-academic impact of the research. Industry-focused research refers to a type of studies in management that are based on an in-depth understanding of particular industry environments and that take account of the contextual details of the industries under investigation. Given that the industrial context in different locations tends to vary  industry-focused research can also contribute to the contextualization of management research in the Asia Pacific region.,Tan  Hao,2017,Asia Pacific Journal of Management,Hao2017,,,Springer,,Making impact through industry-focused research: An Asia Pacific perspective,01f87ba1f81ab4c34a66951063273f7c
2005,Data-sharing among genomic researchers is promoted for its potential to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. However  with genomic data sharing the risks of re-identifying study participants  revealing personal genomic information and data misuse might increase. This study aims at exploring perceptions of patients and physicians in Oncology regarding their assessment of the informational risks resulting from participating in whole genomic research studies in order to improve the informed consent process. For this purpose  we conducted a qualitative focus group study at the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT). Patients and oncologists assessed the informational risks either as minimal or as greater than minimal  depending on the context factors of occupational status  age  and patients’ prognosis. Interestingly  even patients who assumed a greater risk did not refrain from participating in genomic research  provided that certain informational and institutional safeguards are implemented. Moreover  they expected comprehensive disclosure of the risks resulting from genomic data sharing. These results suggest (1) comprehensive disclosure of the risks of genomic research to potential study participants in genomic research to facilitate risk assessment and sound decision making  (2) establishing independent governance entities in order to minimize the informational risks of genomic research  and (3) implementing data sharing policies which offer guidance for physicians and researchers involved in genomic research.,Schleidgen  Sebastian,2017,Philosophy & Technology,Sebastian2017,,,Springer,,Between Minimal and Greater Than Minimal Risk: How Research Participants and Oncologists Assess Data-Sharing and the Risk of Re-identification in Genomic Research,6567f8d30bfa38cfa527965cc499a097

2012,Agile development methods were believed to best suit small  co-located teams  but the success in small teams has inspired use in large and very large-scale software development. However  fundamental assumptions of agile development are challenged when applying the methods at a very large scale. An interpretative revelatory case study on one of the largest software development programmes in Norway shows how agile methods were adapted and complemented with practices from traditional methods to handle the scale. The programme ran over four years with 12 co-located development teams and a total of 175 people involved.

2037,As for the data sparsity and cool boot problem  this paper brings forward a social network recommendation means combined with social tags and trust relations. It collects major information relating to social trust relations  item tag information and user rating matrix based on probabilistic matrix factorization. All the data resources from different dimensions are connected through shared users potential spaces (or item potential spaces). The above mentioned two types of spaces can be obtained by probabilistic matrix factorization.In this way  effective social recommendation means can be achieved. The results generated from Epinions and Movielens experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing Trust-based Social Recommendation or Social Tag Recommendation especially for active users with only a few rating records.,Li  Hui,2017,Cluster Computing,Hui2017,,,Springer,,Research of social recommendation based on social tag and trust relation,4f2e99be20a0a2cf042570aa8b27ae04

2042,The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology  yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other’s work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit  of sharing data in particular  is increased impact ,Marwick  Ben,2017,Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory,Ben2017,,,Springer,,Computational Reproducibility in Archaeological Research: Basic Principles and a Case Study of Their Implementation,6ded420be4d7d382ea56eedf2b6f8fae
2043,Definitely  cloud computing represents a real evolution in the IT world that provides many advantages for both providers and users.

In fact  for some organizations and individuals  data privacy present a crucial aspect of their business. Indeed  their sensitive data (health  finance  personal information  etc.) have a very important value  and any infringement of privacy can cause great loss in terms of money and reputation. Therefore  without considering privacy issues  the adoption of cloud computing can be discarded by large spectra of users. In this paper  we provide a survey on privacy risks and challenges for public cloud computing. We present and evaluate the main existing solutions that have made great progress in this area.

2046,In the era of computation and data-driven research  traditional methods of disseminating research are no longer fit-for-purpose. New approaches for disseminating data  methods and results are required to maximize knowledge discovery.

2053,This paper examines the impact of investment in research and innovation on Australian market sector productivity. While previous studies have largely focused on a narrow class of private sector intangible assets as a source of productivity gains  this paper shows that there is a broad range of other business sector intangible assets that can significantly affect productivity. Moreover  the paper pays special attention to the role played by public funding for research and innovation. The empirical results suggest that there are significant spillovers to productivity from public sector R&D spending on research agencies and higher education. No evidence is found for productivity spillovers from indirect public funding for the business enterprise sector  civil sector or defence R&D. These findings have implications for government innovation policy as they provide insights into possible productivity gains from government funding reallocations.,Elnasri  Amani,2017,Journal of Productivity Analysis,Amani2017,,,Springer,,The contribution of research and innovation to productivity,29205ece701ecb62c83722f86eb2d581

2055,This letter offers a critical evaluation of the use of an inexpensive camera mounted on a recreational unmanned aerial vehicle as a tool for landslide research. The constructed 3D surface models are compared to those generated using a DSLR camera  Total Station and Terrestrial Laser Scanning. It is shown that the investigated approach has considerable potential despite the fact that its performance was slightly inferior to the other methods. This was demonstrated also in a real case study of a small shallow landslide. Nonetheless  in order to assess the real accuracy and precision of the constructed models  it is emphasised that the operator should still have a basic knowledge of the principles of photogrammetry.,Balek  Jan,2017,Landslides,Jan2017,,,Springer,,A critical evaluation of the use of an inexpensive camera mounted on a recreational unmanned aerial vehicle as a tool for landslide research,4199dc6d9937cf0f3b9c79561b06dfb1
